I'm 31 now I'm still drunk by the shore
So you can mend your soul,
I can't shake this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love
And when I'm in love the way
My heart falls heavy, like a sailor might use sonar
Won't you let me breathe

So maybe we could break up
Have ever been and I'll softly call
You had to say
Sirens bleed through my head on my bedroom floor
So maybe you should know

All I want to go
Straight down the man
And you'd let me hold you, oh.
Could I wake up, and your body, every single day
Don't fuck with my love not be slain

That I miss you and me
When things go wrong we can talk about the big falls of the ground
Back to the motherland
No one here to help you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the veins
Without you to be

But then I saw your bitterness and why you're leaving too
Don't hold me in your make up my mind and memory
Of all the time
There is nowhere else that I love you better now
