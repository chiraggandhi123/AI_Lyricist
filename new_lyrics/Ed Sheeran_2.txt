One gun and a time to get on a roll up
You give me love, lover,
You know I can't close my eyes,
But it won't hold it against you,
You and your make up
But something tells me I was in love now

So you can stay with me take a walk on the road Nina
This love's too overrated, see what's going on, on stage, mics on, song plays, nice one
If the sun goes down
Another place to go
And surely you'll never love me good

I would take us
You look like your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And if it don't stop falling, then all of my family is one again
Oh, my friends won't love me good
If you're horny, let's do it for the people to see her

I haven't slept for the last step
Cause you're waiting for that moment to arrive
I'm falling in love now
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake, say it but I've got ya to keep your face
Tell me if you love me, and I

Lord forgive me for now
And keep her from the side now
Or wait to get on a film with you all
If I go for a couple grams
