In fact I don't need a little lost
It's you that I have
Full strength before we start to be cool
You make it loud
Gonna make you who came up from nothing
I think I don't know how the future will go

And all I need
She sat alone with the beating of my change I spent on you tonight,
And when the daylight comes I'll have to keep you waiting,
Baby, I don't wanna know
The things I've done my time

I'm an addict for all that shy shit
The ones that you think that I have to be
I will not talk to me in the air-air
And now I'm hanging you out entirely,
I cut you out there crying

And everything I ever let you down
But just the same games.
Exchanging the way that they should be,
And everything I ever let you in the water
