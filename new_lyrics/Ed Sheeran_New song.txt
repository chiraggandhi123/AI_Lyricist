M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love,
And I'll never hold you close to you
If you feel good.
Give a little love
You make me another one
Done everything I need you darling

If you're horny, let's do it for a couple grams
The music that we could get down in the dead
I feel the same day
But when I met ya
For a couple of days

Whenever it was every time,
Stick the promise man that you won't believe
Be my husband I'll be up again
Would say I'm okay but I'm not a homeless life for me
Open bottles of beer but never what I need you darling

No one here to save the day we fell in love
I lied, I tried to keep my hopes and dreams inside of my mouth
Listen, I wanna see you differently
Come fill to me or burn this out,
You're strumming on my heart on the other side, as this skyline splits in two

Yesterday I was just like glue
Nina oh, won't you leave me lonely now
Of all the time you were a grade eight but I can't make up my mind
And it's been a long time
Those shows have never left me too

And I'm going there to see you differently
And these dreams are all I have, to hold I'll be drunk again
And it's not a family tree
Cause you act like you won't believe
