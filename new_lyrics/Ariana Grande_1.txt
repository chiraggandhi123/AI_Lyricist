So why do I try to run but I can give it to me.
Is it lust? Is it true that the more they take?
And you decided not to make that turn
You got it, you got me open
It's what you don't get whatcha wanted
You got me like ooh

I'm over here doing what I came alive
Simple interaction is all I want
If we give a wink
Makes you wanna go
And I need to live and what to be told

I can't help it I'm just physically obsessed
But that's alright because I love too hard
Then they try to tell you how I know I'm not your only one and only
And I don't have to have you
You drive me crazy?

Just give me all them kisses
And you decided not to make him stay
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I should have been forever but we love the game
We should have told me, boy

So tonight I'm gonna loose ?
But every time I was dreaming bigger than I ever had cause what
But that's alright because I love you whoa
But it's hard to believe we'll find a light inside our universe now
