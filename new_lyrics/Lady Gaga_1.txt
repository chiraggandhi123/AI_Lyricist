I'm on the ceiling
Oh you let it
Didn't know what I will survive
Where we'll both fall far in love with Judas, baby
P p p poker face, p p poker face, p p p poker face
Why can't I be who I am really laughing

Let the beat of the insecure
Just like the ones I used to be alone forever
Changes how I met a better man
You know how it feels
And I'm no, nostradamas yeah,

Oh, oh, a oh oh
Oh we got mice in the dark
Yellow dance and relax, relax
Stop laughing at me like that I've seen him round before
I'll follow you until it clicks

Caught in a game, though in a love game, baby love game
We've got nothing to do
Fang bite tarantula, taste of your neck stands up.
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me if you're a bad kid, baby
With fuzzy hands and a red-state treasure

Bees Eating your heart and your last fix, and your mistress
Yeah something about baby you could really Hollywood kiss me, Hollywood
I won't let you down
Now show me that something's wrong
You must be care

That the world by storm.
Blew down the doors to let you in a crisis
Cover me with your former self
Your in my world up and be gone
