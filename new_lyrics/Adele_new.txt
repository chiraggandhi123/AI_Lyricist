I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco, call it a fiasco, call it home
I'm going back to the ends
What if I hurt you or lie straight to your face against the morning sun
Or don't you remember?
When I found a girl
I miss you when you're right in front of me

When we used to be home soon, I won't go
Bursting at the door.
Mmm, there's only one I want is your love
For a million years ago
But good to be home soon

I like to be home
Although I wish I'd said
But you'd save the best for you when you're ready to love me in the dark
You made a fool out of that town
Oh I can't love you

And be all you need a wife
Hold me like you do
Baby I have a moment
Let's go back there, back to mommy hoping that she's home
