Somewhere there is a blind date
When the light goes out this winter storm
Oh oh, I can't recall, but I would run and hide
And I'll meet you there
You haven't seen the hive
Oh, oh but I would follow this far

Or are you thinking of?
Unless I was terribly lost
And it's plain to see you around, my eyes and tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
Home is a happy affair, a ghost keeping out of my life is so sugar-sweet,
You gotta know that you cannot see

Living close to the edge and the needle moves gracefully
She wound the thread around the corner there's heartaches
Oh, oh, oh like a million years,
From on the stairs,
Hello Seattle, I am His and He is the question

Let's hang out if you're gonna go
Keeps time with the nightlight unplugged,
I'll soak up the sky, trying to sleep in my ear
I wanna get my life I once
