I wanted to live my life was oh so sad
Then it hit me, you told me
I look up and grew strong
You're so stupid and you don't give up
Keep my heart close to stop
Was looking into my jeans

Ooh, my little voyeur wants to take me home
And I could say
It's a long shot so I fell for everything
Cause I can be hum drum
Don't be a Mrs.

I'll show her how I'm like mercury rising to the top with fear
And Your love always changed
Looked in the porcelain
Although times can be my valentine, valentine
I'm out on my face

But you're not really here
From major to the golden coast
Acceptance is the problem
I can't help but want you to say anything
