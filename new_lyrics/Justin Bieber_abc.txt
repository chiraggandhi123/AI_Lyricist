Oh get used to be that easy
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a better way, so you know that if we make it girl
They get on my life complete
I need and I'm sure that it'll be fine, girl you know what I'm supposed to stay
All alone ready to phone me and all of the love that you miss me
Life out of town girl, girl, yeah, yeah

I can't help it I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker
I just can't believe you let it be.
Shout out to me, yeah, yeah
You said you needed a little more because I love you, form of appreciation, yeah ooh
The night of our love was in vein

Don't let me go
You could never believe that love is like
I'll be your prince charming
I'm a young boy
Oh get used to be

If I'm away girl and a quarter tank of gas
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should be me, making you laugh
She right in front of the people standing outside
All about the magic
And I ain't even notice but my money look Yoda

Take her across the glove baby don't be afraid
Maybe I'm in love with me now
Ooh, they hold on to me
But people say it now, go say it now, go say it now, go say it
