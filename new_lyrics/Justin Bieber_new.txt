All I can take it for me to behave
That I'll never be enough
There's something about you babe
Nobody's facing, what I'm made of
I just can't stop thinking about how it could be girl
We can make a better day oh

We got, never get that film it
Say I'm to young for love I sit at starters deck
Befor I was an under-achiever
Oh get used to me so speechless?
You got me like that?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Got me out here in the snow fall
But you didn't believe
Body slammed the beats from D Beat, call me if you didn't know I want us to try oh
Just keep it honest

Ahh, lets do this, just to make yo ass fall off
Not thinking there's a place at your door
Because all the way you move
I know it takes
Home this Christmas time

When I'm in love
And if I hurt you
But I know I'm ready baby
Dwindle in my room
