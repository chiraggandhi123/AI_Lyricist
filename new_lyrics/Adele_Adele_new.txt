And I will always love you in the space so you would be free,
Look how you play
I be your remedy
And I wonder if I stand firm
I'll be home soon, I won't let the lights go out
Look up to your new lover

Sometimes I feel so down
Right before my eyes you were here
Even if I stay I will do until I'm finding myself you
What does it to the light,
Cause what if I cry

You shower me with your cold shoulder
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me down, let me be, oh
I can't wait to see my friends to be alone
Boy I'm tired there ain't no room in my head I'm the only validation
But if I lose my heart out

You've gotta stop holding me the way we remember us
That I never knew, ooh baby
Under haunted skies I see my future in you,
I know I know I'll always mean
I won't let go of all of my doubts

Why were you so cold, let the lights go down
Don't pretend that you know me more than I do, is for you
It illuminates all of our ghosts
Although I wish I was crazy,
