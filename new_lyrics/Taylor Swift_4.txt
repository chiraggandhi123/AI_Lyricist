You made a rebel of a white dress
And you flashback to when he says he will
I thought you'd be here by now
And down here from the crowds went wild
Wake up and sent it
If I was too young

The battle's in your life you'll do things
That's when you were mine
Think of my life with you I'd dance
Why, tell me what more do I get so confused and frustrated
You belong with me too

The other on my make-up,
I don't wanna miss you but I don't know what you don't take some other girl
The jokes on the floor
And we're not speaking and I'm cursing your name
Trying to make me crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier oh

On our last kiss
Every night from the crowds
You've got a busy day today I have to
Can't you see the light
