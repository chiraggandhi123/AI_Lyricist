Anytime I can get.
If I needed someone to love you for ever,
Bye, bye, bye, bye byes.
Go and count a ring or two to tell you now
god bless you please come home.
Take it easy, make it better

Close your eyes and I'll send all my dreams come true.
Roll up roll up for the children play.
As long as you are part of everything
Lucy in the morning it will go
She puts my heart and leaves me sad.

Molly stays at home and cry over you
It's been a naughty boy, you let your knickers down.
And I do a request that you want me to pretend
Then I could die.
John: He was such a joy

It's not so self-assured,
Named Johnny B. Goode tonight!
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
Love, love me baby,
The love I have got another girl

Every time you do to me?
But like you gotta carry that weight a long lonely time
Back in the ocean
That's how I feel hung up and they called it me
