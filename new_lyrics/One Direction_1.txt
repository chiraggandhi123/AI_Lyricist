Tight dress with the freckles on your own
What a feeling to be like them
You want to be right here in it's cage
I can feel the same thing
She's the one that's in command
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn in it all yeah, who could've planned it?

Nothing you can take it
I'm half a blue sky
I'll take you there, take you there, yeah I know they'll be coming to find you but I figured out from the playground
Cause I wanna do
So tell me what you do is say that I won't hesitate no more, no more

And giving back is all you do
Driving to your feet
Baby let me go, don't let me kiss you once now I can't hold you down,
Everybody wanna take it to be a good night
Baby you light up every second of the things I want

It's so right you know you wanna cry or fall apart
Open up your almost done
Same old shh but we never say never,
But I'm not scared of love hate
All I ever wanted was the best but expecting the worst,

Don't make me strong?
Hey, I don't wanna take you and say it all
Need to take it slow
We built it up Go
We did that when I saw your face

Remember the day that we been through
To get me out
At the end of the verses, well, they've got me lifted off my feet
Baby let me kiss you once now I can't give up
