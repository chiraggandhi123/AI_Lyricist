Never getting dry so I could look into your loving arms
Is not the only one
You see I'm searching for what used to lay to rest again,
Angels to die cause death the only one
How'd I get high smoke in the sand
Listen, I wanna be loved

Was that Marilyn was found in the floor, see the bruises that I'm covering,
Until you disappeared with him to bed that's all
Can I be me for now
Oh oh oh oh
And all I've done I think I love my lover

And you're not the way our horizons meet
Don't fuck with my thoughts dance with my love
My, my, my, oh give me love, lover,
Or we'll be together oh
All my words are all I have, to hold me,

And all my friends won't love me like you are the color of red like the way
She's like cold coffee in the oceans you made
To help you pain
All I want is the start of something beautiful
And I said that's fine but you're the only thing that I love you better than I let on,

Can't rely on my own
Close your eyes and see the flicker of the program
But I wasn't there
And maybe I can feel like you
