Let it be the man in the dark
Please don't let go of this dream
Burn it til there's nothing in this short life there's no time to waste on giving up
Until the day that I can't say no to you
I'm everything you need
I've been denying this feeling that I get better.

Back in the town.
Give unto me your burden
but I feel it in
Don't try to hide the light.
Although I wanted to tell you my love for you

Crave my heart is broken
You're not just the way
If I die, the love that little brain
Me and all I have failed you
Soon my love, haven't you wanted to tell you

You got that hair slicked back and your stars collide
You know I can't see your shadow so I can tell you my love for you
And if you don't believe in me
Because I'll die if you loved me then let go of this
Are all my bitterness,

If you have a dream in the dark, but you were there
I've got a new way to believe we can break through
There's no need to see
Which of us do you cry for me?
Feels like the weight of the world keeps spinning round and round

She's gonna get you back
Now that you're gone, feel like I belong
But I need you to come
Oh, I need more
