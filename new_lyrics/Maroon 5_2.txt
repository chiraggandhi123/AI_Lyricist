Try so hard to do with meaning it
Come away to the top of me
If you want to cry
Making me walk out the lights went off
And I can't stop thinking about you every single day
They don't know what to do it again

And I can do,
Hate to love you, oh in your hair
I am I gonna do
Summer will end and the poor ones
You'll understand what I need

Baby you got nobody to love you, no
My reasons why you spying on me
Try to stay awake but you missed your last shot
Telegram came today from a cleaner point of view
Who'll throw it all take all that I could think that I could never live without.

Come knock on my mind, stuck inside my head up spinning
All alone in my guts
The air that I could have a good start
I don't expect you to forgive me now
