All alone in my room think of you at a rate that is truly alarming  
I keep grouping my memories of you in my head, I pretend that you want me  
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities  
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about your love  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go  
I was wrestling with you in my dreams, and wake up making love to a pillow  
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities  
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me  
  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And you never go on till I do  
And I can't stop, and I can't stop  
  
What I would give to have you look in my direction  
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention  
And I touch myself like it's somebody else  
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind  
Let me show you  
  
I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
And I can't stop thinking about you  
I can't stop thinking about you  
You never go on till I do  
And I can't stop thinking about you


How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable  
So condescending unnecessarily critical  
I have the tendency of getting very physical  
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle  
  
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here  
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear  
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone  
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on  
  
[Chorus]  
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say  
There's no way we're gonna give up  
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
  
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head  
You should know better you never listened to a word I said  
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat  
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did  
  
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say  
There's no way we're gonna give up  
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
  
Does it kill  
Does it burn  
Is it painful to learn  
That it's me that has all the control  
  
Does it thrill  
Does it sting  
When you feel what I bring  
And you wish that you had me to hold  
  
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love  
You'll understand what I mean when I say  
There's no way we're gonna give up  
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe  
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe


Living easy, livin' free  
Season ticket, on a one - way ride  
Asking nothing, leave me be  
Taking everything in my stride  
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme  
Ain't nothing I would rather do  
Going down, party time  
My friends are gonna be there too  
  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
  
No stop signs, speedin' limit  
Nobody's gonna slow me down  
Like a wheel, gonna spin it  
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round  
Hey Satan! Paid my dues  
Playin' in a rockin' band  
Hey Mama! Look at me  
I'm on my way to the promise land  
  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
I'm on the highway to hell  
Highway to hell  
  
Don't stop me!  
  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
I'm on the highway to hell!  
  
And I'm goin down... all the way!  
I'm on the highway to hell...


If I fell in love with you  
Would you promise to be true  
And help me understand  
'Cause I've been in love before  
And I found that love was more  
Than just holding hands  
  
If I give my heart to you  
I must be sure  
From the very start  
That you would love me more than her  
  
If I trust in you oh please  
Don't run and hide  
If I love you too oh please  
Don't hurt my pride like her  
  
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain  
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain  
So I hope you see that I  
Would love to love you  
And that she will cry  
When she learns we are two  
  
If I fell in love with you


I wake up  
Thoughts of you  
Tattooed to my mind  
As I wonder  
What to wear  
What to eat  
Who to be  
Will I see you again  
  
And as my car breaks down  
I shake my head and say  
What a day  
  
If you only knew  
What I went through just to get to you  
I'm hanging from you  
And I'll hold on if you want me to  
  
Every bus, every train,  
Ever cab, every lane is jammed  
So I looked to the sky  
And I reached for the planes with my hands  
  
If all my days go wrong  
I'll think about last night  
It went right  
  
If you only knew  
What I went through just to get to you  
I'm hanging from you  
And I'll hold on if you want me to  
  
If you only knew  
What I went through just to get to you  
I'm swinging from you  
And there's nothing I would rather do


Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning  
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life, we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize, it was always you  
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you  
  
No more saying who  
Looking by now I know it was always you, always you  
All my hidden desires finally came alive  
No, I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight  
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life, we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize, it was always you  
Can't believe I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you  
  
Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
  
It was always you  
Even if I couldn't not see it all this time, all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied  
It was always you, you


I'm sure that he could give you everything  
Stability and diamond rings  
All the things I do not have  
I understand you can't handle that  
But for everything that I lack  
I provide something you almost had  
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab  
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad  
  
So oh, what you gonna do.  
I'm in love with you  
Don't you wanna dance  
This might be the last chance  
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh  
  
Out of sight, not out of mind  
You want the world, I'll give you mine  
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find  
And I'm the boy you left behind  
I know you think you're satisfied  
And God knows how hard we tried  
But if you showed up at my door  
I could give you so much more oh  
  
Oh, what you gonna do  
I'm in love with you  
Don't you wanna dance  
This may be the last chance  
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh  
  
Oh, what am I gonna do  
I don't have to lose  
You're not making sense  
This might be the last chance  
That you get to love me, oh  
  
You sure don't make it easy  
To get myself to safety  
You tell me that I'm crazy  
But you're the one who makes me this way  
You call me so impulsive  
But that's what makes us so explosive  
  
So as I burn these photographs  
I wonder if you kept the ones you have  
Keep them locked up safe  
Since it's the only place you'll see my face  
  
Oh, what you gonna do  
I'm in love with you  
Why don't you wanna dance  
'Cause this might be the last chance  
That I get to love you, oh oh oh  
Oh, what am I gonna do  
I don't like to lose  
You're not making sense  
'Cause this may be the last chance  
That you get to love me, oh  
  
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh  
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh oh oh  
To love you, oh oh oh


[Verse 1]  
You got in so late, it's Sunday morning  
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us  
Where did we go wrong?  
And now you say you're leaving California  
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight  
Pack your things and go  
  
[Pre-hook]  
But if you run away  
I won't be alright  
  
[Hook]  
Even if the sun crashes into us  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on  
Put them back together, do it all for love  
Never let it go  
Cause I don't need a reason just to hold ya  
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes  
Baby please don't go  
  
[Pre-hook]  
But if you run away  
I won't be alright  
  
[Hook]  
Even if the sun crashes into us  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Now you say you're leaving California


I have told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home.  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
I can't find anythin to be sad about.  
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine.  
I have tried  
So very hard as hell  
To stay away from them  
And go upstairs.  
When I see  
All of your remedies  
I try more desperately to go home.  
I can't find anythin to be sad about.  
They say I'm doomed but I feel fine.  
But if I'm seatin here lonely,  
With no one to hold me,  
At least i'll have my health.  
I'm tryin to control myself.  
I hav told  
All of my enemies  
Very politely  
To go home.  
I have seen  
All of your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
I've been acting irresponsibly  
Oh what could possibly go wrong.  
I have choked on all your remedies  
Now wont you let me please go home.  
But if I'm seatin here lonely,  
With no one to hold me,  
At least i'll have my health.  
I'm tryin to control myself.


I'll be your sun and your moon tonight  
I can be whatever you like  
I was alone but I met it a few  
I wanna show you my feelings are real, yeah  
All this time I've been living it up  
And every night I'd be falling in love  
But I'm finally seeing the light  
Falling in love with you every night

But if I ever let you down  
If I ever let you down  
Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me now

Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me  
This is a new love

Would it kill you to forgive me  
  
What the fuck, I got nothing to lose  
I'm a slave of the way that you move  
I'm an addict for all that you do  
You're the only drug I wanna do yeah  
I can tell that you're needing my love  
And all I want is to give it to you  
And don't give up on the moment tonight  
You're a [?] the rest of your life  
  
But if I ever let you down  
If I ever let you down  
Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me now  
But if I ever let you down  
If I ever let you down  
Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me  
This is a new love  
This is a new love  
This is a new love  
Would it kill you to forgive me

Cause if you don't know it yet  
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy yeah  
Cause I know I lie  
And it wouldn't kill you child  
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me  
Till you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me

If I ever let you down  
Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me now  
But if I ever let you down  
If I ever let you down  
Forgive me, forgive me, now  
Would it kill you to forgive me  
This is a new love  
This is a new love  
This is a new love  
Would it kill you to forgive me


And the muggers that day  
  
Several million lovers  
Of that dress that's in the window display  
And every day they'd say  
  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver don't stay  
  
She was quite a woman  
Quite an understanding woman she was  
  
Sure I really loved her  
But she acted like a mother to me  
And she loved me and I'd scream  
  
Nancy  
Nancy  
Nancy  
Please take care of me  
  
Oliver, Oliver  
Oliver, Oliver  
Oliver  
  
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh  
  
I was overblown by all the card sharks  
And the muggers that day  
  
Several million lovers  
Of that dress that's in the window display  
And every day they'd say  
  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver  
Oliver don't stay


You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war  
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door  
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score  
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more  
  
But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you  
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo  
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid coming back to you  
  
So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I'll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I'll only stay with you one more night  
  
Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes  
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath  
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself  
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell  
  
But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you  
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo  
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid running back to you  
  
So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I'll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I'll only stay with you one more night  
  
Yeah baby give me one more night  
Yeah baby give me one more night  
Yeah baby give me one more night  
  
Baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you  
And I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I'll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I'll only stay with you one more night  
(Yeah baby give me one more night)  
  
So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I'll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I'll only stay with you one more night


Tell me actions speak louder  
But there's something about her words, that hurt  
Closing up and it's so late and  
I'm the last one still waiting for ya, to lock the door  
  
On our way home I realize  
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that I've done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
'Cause we're out of goodbyes  
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes  
  
Never asked you to change  
But sadly you don't feel the same, about me  
I wonder does your man still shudder when you touch his hand  
Like this man  
  
On our way home I realize  
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes  
Only veiled by a thin disguise  
  
Now that I've done my time  
I need to move on and I need you to try  
'Cause we're out of goodbyes  
We're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes  
Oh, ooh


I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
No, I, I know it's hard to remember  
The people we used to be  
It's even harder to picture  
That you're not here next to me  
You say it's too late to make it  
But is it too late to try?  
And in our time that you wasted  
All of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my life  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time when we called it love  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a pay phone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
You turn your back on tomorrow  
'Cause you forgot yesterday  
I gave you my love to borrow  
But you just gave it away  
You can't expect me to be fine  
I don't expect you to care  
I know I've said it before  
But all of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my nights  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed  
Still stuck in that time when we called it love  
But even the Sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
And all those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
Now I'm at a payphone  
  
Man, that  
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sittin' round  
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing  
Made it from the botton  
Now when you see me I'm stuning  
And all of my cars start with a push of a button  
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it  
Switched the number to my phone  
So you never could call it  
Don't need my name, on my shirt  
You can tell it I'm ballin'  
  
Swish, what a shame coulda got picked  
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot  
So you talk about who you see at the top  
Or what you could've saw  
But sad to say it's over for her  
Phantom roll up valet open doors  
Wish I'd go away, got what you was looking for  
Now it's me who they want  
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone?  
Baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If happy ever after did exist  
I would still be holding you like this  
And all those fairytales are full of shit  
One more stupid love song I'll be sick  
  
I'm at a payphone!


Come with me, and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination  
  
We'll begin with a spin  
Traveling in the world of my creation  
What we'll see will defy explanation  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world, there's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world, there's nothing to it  
  
Come with me, and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be


You build me up  
You knock me down  
Provoke a smile  
And make me frown  
You are the queen of runaround  
You know it's true  
  
You chew me up  
And spit me out  
Enjoy the taste  
I leave in your mouth  
You look at me  
I look at you  
Neither of us know what to do  
  
There may not  
Be another way to your heart  
So I guess I'd better find a new way in  
I shiver when i hear your name  
Think about you but it's not the same  
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin  
  
Immobilized by the thought of you  
Paralyzed by the sight of you  
Hypnotized by the words you say  
Not true but I believe 'em anyway  
  
So come to bed it's getting late  
There's no more time for us to waste  
Remember how my body tastes  
You feel you heart being to race


You gotta let it go  
Cause we're losing grip now  
It's about to go down  
With you let me talk to you  
You gotta let me know  
Cause I'm on the edge now  
Of a nerve-breakdown  
Cause I can't get through to you  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot  
  
You never let me go  
Got me chained to your touch  
Like a slave for you love  
I'm ashamed to say it's true  
Afraid to let you go  
Cause without you I'm lost  
And not matter the cost  
I'm standing next to you  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot  
  
My back's against the world tonight  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
I see the fear that's in your eyes  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
Go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot love  
Don't shoot love baby  
Don't shoot


People never change,  
They seem to stay the same.  
They wear different clothes,  
But play the same games.  
  
Many different ways  
To say the same thing.  
Searching for the right words,  
The ones that would make you stay.  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be,  
Yeah.  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her,  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
Oh I'm not even really sure  
Who made this mess,  
And who threw what punch,  
But I could not care less.  
All I know is that I'm here  
And you are not, oh  
Once I put this wasted pride aside,  
Nothing's all I got, oh  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be, yeah  
  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her,  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
Oh,  
Somebody make it stop  
Yeah  
And pick me up,  
And just dust me off, oh  
The rainy day flood,  
Will drowned all this love.  
Trapped at the bottom now  
Please dig me up.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.


Every day, people sway  
Softly lulling me to sleep  
I look the other way  
But I still can't look too deep  
I think I'll fall asleep  
I think I'll fall asleep  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everything's gonna be fine  
  
Every night, people fight  
Gently lulling me to sleep  
What gives me the right  
To waste away and weep  
I think I'll turn away  
There's nothing left to say  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everything's gonna be fine  
So you wanna have everything your heart desires  
There's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire  
Make your way on up to the front of the line  
  
Get out of my way  
I'm here now to stay  
Get out of my way  
I'm here now to stay  
  
So call up and tell him that you will survive  
Good looking kid with the velvet eyes  
You and me and everything's gonna be fine  
So you wanna have everything your heart desires  
There's a fist full of people with their hearts on fire  
Make your way on up to the front of the line


Making love to a picture frame  
One more time tonight  
You can tell by the lines in her smile  
Something is not right  
  
Where are you hiding (hiding)  
She's on the outside  
I'm on the inside crying (crying)  
Just another crazy boy  
Hungry for your  
  
[Chorus]  
Hot love  
Wrap yourself around me like a  
Warm glove  
The emptiness leaves me and I'm  
Filled up  
Never need to  
Go back to the way I was  
The way I was  
  
I tried and tried and tried and tried  
But I have no concept of consequence  
And I'm a master of self defense  
Days get longer  
Life gets shorter  
She rips me like no other  
So oh dripping from head to toe  
  
Where are you hiding (hiding)  
She's on the outside  
I'm on the inside crying (crying)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I can't make the same mistake  
If you lose my love  
It was yours to take  
Break down your door  
Take a little more  
When I need you around  
  
And I'm so terrified of leaving  
It's a new low  
Try and pick me up again but  
Let go see how far I get without you  
Desperately need more of your  
  
[Chorus: x2]


[Hook]  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  
Fucker  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker  
Fucker  
  
[Verse 1]  
Her body's hot  
Her body's like the summer  
I'm in a trance or something  
Her mind is not, no  
As sharp as all her diamonds  
She must be smoking something  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I see her dancing in the streets  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause she's so fancy  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2]  
She wants it all  
She's always taking something  
And now I'm left with nothing  
I'm ripping off, oh  
I'm ripping off that bandage  
Because I just can't stand it  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
I see her dancing on a fool  
Like she's seventeen and cool  
She really thinks that she can move  
But it's just nasty  
I see her when I go to sleep  
I check my phone when I am weak  
She never posts anything deep  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Middle Eight]  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
She's so popular  
(Whoo!)  
Has to have it all  
Chases every star  
She's so popular  
(Ohh)  
  
This summer's gonna hurt  
It's gonna hurt  
  
I see her dancing in the street  
Sipping champagne on the beach  
So expensive when she eats  
Cause she's so fancy  
Cause she's so fancy  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker


If you respect me  
Don't protect me  
You can tell me, I can handle it  
Stop pretending, cause we're going down  
If you let go, then just let go  
It's disrespectful how you've handled this  
Never ending, kinda round around  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted  
No you don't have to love me  
If you don't wanna  
Don't act like I mean nothing  
But if you're gonna  
Well, when you're better off  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
  
Can't erase this, can't delete this  
I don't need this, I can't handle it  
I just feel it, that you're over us  
If I wait here, if I see you  
It won't matter, what's the point of this?  
We're in pieces, because you're over us  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You can't light a fire, if the candle's melted  
No you don't have to love me  
If you don't wanna  
Don't act like I mean nothing  
But if you're gonna  
Well, when you're better off  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
Unkiss me  
Unkiss me  
  
So baby let go  
Gotta let go  
It's disrespectful how you've handled this  
Never ending, kinda round around  
  
Unkiss me, untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
So unkiss me  
So unkiss me  
Unkiss me


I didn't hear what you were saying  
I live on raw emotion, baby  
I answer questions, never maybe  
And I'm not kind if you betray me  
So, who the hell are you to save me?  
I never would have made it, babe  
  
[Bridge]  
If you needed love  
Well, then, ask for love  
Could have given love  
Now I'm taking love  
And it's not my fault  
'Cause you both deserve  
What's coming now  
So don't say a word  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't think so  
  
Would have bled to make you happy  
You didn't need to treat me that way  
And now you beat me at my own game  
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly  
And your lover's screaming loudly  
I hear a sound and hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
I don't feel so bad  
I don't feel so bad  
  
I'm so sorry, darling  
Did I do the wrong thing?  
Oh, what was I thinking?  
Is his heart still beating?  
  
Whoa, oh, oh  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore  
Come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
  
Wake up call  
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed  
Don't you care about me anymore?  
Don't you care about me?  
I don't think so  
Six foot tall  
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead  
He won't come around here anymore, no  
He won't come around here?  
I don't feel so bad  
  
(Wake up call)  
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)  
(Don't you care about me anymore?)  
(Don't you care about me?)  
(I don't feel so bad)  
(Wake up call)  
(Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)  
(Don't you care about me anymore)


[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Verse 1]  
So what you trying to do to me,  
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies,  
But we get along when I'm inside you.  
You're like a drug that's killing me,  
I cut you out entirely,  
But I get so high when I'm inside you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free,  
You can find other fish in the sea,  
You can pretend it's meant to be,  
But you can't stay away from me.  
I can still hear you making that sound,  
Taking me down rolling on the ground,  
You can pretend that it was me, but no.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Verse 2]  
So if I run, it's not enough,  
You're still in my head, forever stuck,  
So you can do, what you wanna do.  
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up,  
But don't deny the animal  
That comes alive when I'm inside you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free,  
You can find other fish in the sea,  
You can pretend it's meant to be,  
But you can't stay away from me.  
I can still hear you making that sound,  
Taking me down rolling on the ground,  
You can pretend that it was me, but no.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Bridge]  
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
[Break]  
Yo, woahh, woahh...  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, mals.  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, mals.  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I'm preying on you tonight,  
Hunt you down, eat you alive,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves.  
Maybe you think that you can hide,  
I can smell your scent from miles,  
Just like animals, animals,  
Like animals, wolves,  
Baby I'm...  
  
[Outro]  
Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie,  
You can't deny, ny, ny, ny,  
The beast inside, side, side, side,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


You have this way of dipping in and out of  
Sight as things collide  
Bridges burning softly in the night  
And you have this way of falling in and out of  
Time as it goes by  
Passing silently with no goodbye  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  
  
Telegram came today from a friend  
Saying, "Where in the hell have you been?  
Where are you goin'? "  
I said, "I don't know, does the loneliness show?  
And if so does it ever end? "  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do  
  
You have this way of meaning everything and nothing to me  
At the same time  
Returning my hellos with goodbyes  
  
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  
  
'Cause I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do...  
  
And I've spoken with all the other angels  
They don't know what to do  
And I agree with them whole-heartedly, I do


From the moment the lights went off  
Everything had changed  
Lie awake in an empty room  
In my head it all feels the same  
  
Like the taste of the day you left  
It still lingers on my breath  
And the dampness of tears that left  
The stain where you had wept  
  
All alone with the negligee  
That still hangs off of my bed  
I keep meaning to give it away  
But I just leave it there instead  
  
[Chorus]  
No need to cry about it  
I cannot live without it  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
Why do you do this to me?  
You penetrate right through me  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
  
Three more days till I see your face  
I'm afraid it's far too much  
Cook a meal and fix up the place  
Dial your number, hang it up  
  
If I took you for granted  
I apologize for acting tough  
You're my reason for living  
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, every evening is a bitter fight  
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night  
And I know what your friends say  
"He's just wasting your love and time."  
I will never let you change your mind  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Every time I wind up back at your door  
Every time I wind up back at your door


I count the ways I let you down  
On my fingers and toes but I'm running out  
Clever words can't help me now  
I grip you tight but you're slipping out  
  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, so in love that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
  
When did the rain become a storm  
When did the clouds begin to form  
Yeah we got knocked off course by a natural force  
And well, we'll be swimming when it's gone  
  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, so in love that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye, bye bye, bye bye  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye whoa (bye bye, bye bye)  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
  
All the pain you try to hide  
Shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes  
And let 'em go, let 'em fly  
Holding back won't turn back time  
Believe me, I've tried  
  
Your eyes were so bright  
And I remember your eyes were so bright  
I remember your eyes were so bright  
When I first I met you, how in love were we that night  
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight  
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry  
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), oh yeah  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye),  
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye), whoa  
It's dripping from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye), yeah yeah  
  
Beau, oh yeah


I never knew perfection till  
I heard you speak, and now it kills me  
Just to hear you say the simple things  
Now waking up is hard to do  
And sleeping's impossible, too  
Everything is reminding me of you  
What can I do?  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not right, not okay  
Say the word that you say  
Maybe we're better off this way  
I'm not fine, I'm in pain  
It's harder everyday  
Maybe we're better off this way  
It's better that we break  
  
A fool to let you slip away  
I chase you just to hear you say  
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane  
  
The city looks so nice from here  
Pity, I can't see it clearly  
While you're standing there, it disappears  
It disappears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Saw you sitting all alone  
You're fragile, and you're cold  
But that's all right  
Life these days is getting rough  
They've knocked you down and beat you up  
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not fine, not okay  
Say the word that you say  
Maybe we're better off this way  
  
I'm not fine, and I'm in pain  
It's harder everyday  
Maybe we're better off this way  
It's better that we break, baby


Nobody cares  
about ocean affairs  
He's by himself 'cause nobody loves him  
Cleaning his sand  
Filled boots with his hand  
Looking for something but nothing sees him  
  
Happy was he  
in spite of his knee  
That wasn't there because of his day job  
There was a man  
who took to the band  
paying attention tried to adhere him  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled finding a plan  
  
Seemingly fine  
he slipped on his wine  
Terra was healthy but not on a mission  
  
There was a sea  
A mythical tease  
Our cannons were shot  
"til we couldn't afford them  
  
Others would have died alone  
Angels all worked free  
Timeless fairs and sing-alongs  
Speaking naturally  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled deep hand in hand  
All the way  
from the bay  
I could hear them say  
All the time  
we were dead  
And I'm Cap' Splendid  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled deep hand in hand  
All the way  
from the bay  
I could hear them say  
I don't care  
if we're dead  
And I'm Cap Splendid


Come away little loss  
Come away to the water  
To the ones that are waiting only for you  
Come away little loss  
Come away to the water  
Away from the life that you always knew  
We are calling to you  
Come away little light  
Come away to the darkness  
In the shade of the night we'll come looking for you  
Come away little light  
Come away to the darkness  
To the ones appointed to see it through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the water  
Give yourself so we might live anew  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the slaughter  
To the ones appointed to see this through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the water  
To the arms that are waiting only for you  
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter  
To the one appointed to see this through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
We are coming for you  
We are coming for you


Come talk with me  
Take off your coat  
Sit down for awhile  
Stick around for awhile  
  
It's been a long year  
My luck is down think  
I'll skip town for awhile  
To search for my smile  
  
You look so nice  
You shine just like an angel  
But I'm sure that you must get that all the time  
  
Have you heard that new song on the radio  
It reminds me of us  
But I forget how it goes  
  
Its been a long week  
And my mind is tired  
I think I'll sit down for a while  
Settle down for a while  
You look so nice  
You shine just like the morning  
And at 9PM you glow just like the night  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You won't talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
You're coming down down down  
You're coming down down down down down  
  
You won't see me  
You won't leave me  
Leave me where I am I am  
  
You won't see me  
You won't leave me  
Leave me where I am  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You won't talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
You're coming down down down  
You're coming down down down down down  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You won't talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
You're coming down down down  
You're coming down down down down down  
  
Come talk with me  
Take off your coat  
Sit down for a while  
Stick around for a while


Looking at the same sky that we used to live under  
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?

Giving that love and emotion that I know  
Cause I really mind what you do

Coming back for you

But I will come running for you I don't care how far  
When you close your eyes  
Do you see me love?

Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon  
Why am I, still holding on?  
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along  
How did it come so fast?  
This is our last night but it's late  
And I'm trying not to sleep  
'Cause I know, when I wake  
I will have to slip away  
  
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go  
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close  
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
  
Here I am staring at your perfection  
In my arms, so beautiful  
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out  
Somebody slow it down  
This is way too hard  
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up  
I will leave, this is my last glance  
That will soon be memory  
  
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go  
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close  
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
  
I never wanted to stop  
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over  
I was afraid of the dark  
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want  
  
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go  
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close  
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
  
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go  
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close  
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
  
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah)  
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa


Oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone  
You're hanging up and I am all alone  
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt  
And now I wanna find you but you're off the run  
My heart's exploding like a burning sun  
And I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts  
  
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night  
You're shining like a neon light  
I light you up when I get inside  
So won't you touch me 'cause everybody's watching us now  
We're putting on a show for the crowd  
So turn it up baby make it loud  
  
Hey you, say that you're only having fun and then  
You call me up at three A-M again  
Baby you got me doing dirt, doing dirt, doing dirt  
And now all that I got is just a microphone  
To let you know that I am all alone  
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts  
  
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night  
You're shining like a neon light  
I light you up when I get inside  
So won't you touch me 'cause everybody's watching us now  
We're putting on a show for the crowd  
So turn it up baby make it loud

So turn it up baby make it loud


Living inside my head pulling my strings  
Letting me think I'm in control  
Giving you all of my heart was a good start  
But it turns out you want my soul  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
I'm tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
So tell me what you really want (really want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be, no I don't wanna be alone  
Ooh, alone now, oh yeah, don't wanna be  
  
(Uh) Pushing me over the edge  
Can't forget those things you said  
Cut to the bone  
Go ahead, take your swing  
What did you think?  
I was just gonna roll over,oh no  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all  
I'm tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
Gotta tell me what you really want (what you want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be  
No, I don't wanna be alone  
Ooh, alone now  
I don't wanna be  
  
I'm putting myself on the line  
And I'm tired of wasting my time  
There's got to be a reason why  
She will not talk to me  
  
No I, I don't know nothing 'bout that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
So tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
Oh yeah  
  
I don't know nothing about that  
In fact I don't know nothing at all, yeah  
So tired of proving you right  
By doing everything so wrong (so wrong)  
  
Yeah tell me what you really want (what you want)  
'Cause I don't wanna be  
No, I don't wanna be alone  
Yeah, doin' everything so wrong


[Oasis cover]  
  
Slip inside the eye of your mind  
Don't you know you might find  
A better place to play  
  
You said that you've never been  
But all the things that you've seen  
They slowly fade away  
  
So I'll start a revolution from my bed  
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside the summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
And so, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
Take me to the place where you go  
Where nobody knows  
If it's night or day  
  
Please don't put your life in the hands  
Of a rock and roll band  
Who'll throw it all away  
  
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed  
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside, cause summertime's in bloom  
  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
So, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
So, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
Don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
At least not today.


[Intro]  
Oh hey  
Oh hey  
Oh hey  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]  
Wasted (wasted)  
And the more I drink the more I think about you  
Oh no, no, I can't take it  
Baby every place I go reminds me of you  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]  
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?  
Is it better now that I'm not around?  
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name  
Are you happy now?  
Are you happy now?  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
  
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]  
And every time I go out, yeah  
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one  
That you got someone new  
Yeah, I see but don't believe it  
Even in my head you're still in my bed  
Maybe I'm just a fool  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]  
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?  
Is it better now that I'm not around?  
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name  
Are you happy now?  
Are you happy now?  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
  
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]  
(Oh hey)  
No more "please stop"  
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots  
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday  
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh  
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?  
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?  
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be  
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah  
  
[Chorus: Adam Levine]  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know, know, know, know  
Who's taking you home, home, home, home  
And loving you so, so, so, so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
  
[Outro]  
Oh hey  
Oh hey  
Oh hey  
Oh, oh


She sits all alone reading books and drinkin wine  
Admires all the cracks by the doorway  
She tries to look happy but she's slowly running out of smiles  
Gracefully wasting away  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing?  
Who is gonna be her everything?  
Everyday goodbyes  
  
She foolishly tries to convince herself that she'll be fine  
She blows all her kisses to none  
As the phone rings again, she just closes her eyes  
She covers her ears and screams "please not today!"  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing?  
Who is gonna be her everything?  
Everyday goodbyes  
  
She cries and then she sighs  
And gets down on her knees yelling "I don't believe what has happened to me"  
She cries and then she sighs  
And gets down on her knees yelling "I don't believe what has happened to me"  
  
Who is gonna make the birds sing?  
Who is gonna be her everything?  
Everyday goodbyes  
(Repeat)


I'm so cool, too bad I'm a loser  
I'm so smart, too bad I can't get anything figured out  
I'm so brave, too bad I'm a baby  
I'm so fly, that's probably why it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
I'm so green, it's really amazing  
I'm so clean, too bad I can't get all the dirt off of me.  
I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy  
It's so strange, I can't believe it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?  
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind  
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
It feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
I'm so chill, no wonder it's freezing  
I'm so still, I just can't keep my fingers out of anything  
I'm so thrilled to finally be failing  
I'm so done, turn me over cause it  
Feels just like I'm falling for the first time  
  
Anything plain can be lovely, anything loved can be lost  
Maybe I lost my direction, what if our love is the cost?  
Anyone perfect must be lying, anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely, anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction? What if I lost sense of time?  
What if I nursed this infection? Maybe the worst is behind!


You and me and all that wild  
Losing my collar dammit fly  
Every guy that passes by  
Look at her, look at her oh

But where does he think you are tonight  
Does he know you're nasty inside

And I can't help myself no more  
Can't fight these feelings for you  
No I can't help myself no more

I'm happy you came to me first  
Before the bubble burst  
I'm happy you answered my calls  
I'm bouncing off the walls  
Impossible to be tamed  
Her need- celophane  
I'm happy you like to play games  
Why did you run away?  
  
We could spend some time together  
What he had he'll never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So lets figure it out let's go.  
  
I'm happy you're so impulsive  
Means that your passionate  
I'm happy you're moving so fast  
But will it ever last  
I know you wanna break free  
From this monotony  
I'm happy you're coming with me  
But by choice its gotta be  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he has he'll never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
  
So figure it out lets go  
  
I'm happy you're changing your speed  
Slow down and lay with me  
On bottom but always discrete  
Kneel down and kiss her feet  
I'm happy your going too far  
Full strength before we start  
Sometimes you make it so hard  
Scream loud as we come apart  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he had he'll never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So figure it out lets go  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he has he'll never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets  
Go


I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news  
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you  
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball  
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all  
  
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say  
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today  
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try  
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again  
  
I don't know why you're acting like this  
I don't know why you had to do it again  
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night  
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means  
And your American dream, baby it just isn't me  
I know that what I'm thinking may not be on your mind  
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind  
  
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say  
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today  
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try  
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again  
  
I don't know why you're acting like this  
I don't know why you had to do it again  
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night  
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
This feeling keeps growing  
These rivers keep flowing  
How can I have answers  
When you drown me in questions  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
And I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
I'll never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller


Funky is the word,  
You're right,  
Or grow strong,  
Funky is the word.  
  
Oh, this is so funky,  
Funky in my heart,  
This girl is funky,  
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.  
  
Funky, oh that's the word,  
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?  
Can you just see me lone-ly?  
Funky is the word you could only say.  
  
It's so funky,  
Jane, can't you see?  
You could be loved by any boy in the world,  
Funky, it's the word.  
  
The word is funky,  
The word is funky,  
Oh how a shame,  
It's too funky.

You are relentless, I am defenseless  
Why did you knock me down tonight  
You beat me senseless, I just don't get this  
How many times do I have to try  
  
Your whisper, so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
It's impossible to express  
How good it feels  
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed  
So tight I'll never be free  
I'm not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door

You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
Please don't resist anymore  
I'll never leave you alone  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
You reprimand me, you're so demanding  
But I've got time, I don't mind at all  
You're picture perfect, completely worth it  
You've got my back against the wall  
  
Your whisper, so clear  
The world disappears  
As I fall into the darkness  
Impossible to express  
How good it feels  
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed  
So tight I'll never be free yea  
I'm not gonna fight the feeling  
  
Get back in my life  
Come knock on my door

You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
Please don't resist anymore

Can you feel me coming  
I'm screaming, searching, calling  
Paranoid,  
Cause I'm always coming back to you,  
Coming back to you  
And you know how much I missed it  
And you know I can't resist it  
See your lips and just come running  
Right on back to you, right on back to you  
  
Get back in my life, come knock on my door  
What I'm looking for, I think you should know  
You started a fire, burned me to the floor  
I can't do this anymore  
I'll never leave you alone

'Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh, get a little more from you babe


I've taken time  
To think about the words I've said and what they mean  
And I've realized that having you is just like having everything  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
It's been so long  
It seems the only things I know are far from home  
Where did I go  
It seems sometimes I'm only good at being gone  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
But when I see you standing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
Home, home  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home


You left me hanging from a thread we once swung from together  
I licked my wounds, but I can't ever see them getting better  
Something's gotta change  
Things cannot stay the same  
  
Her hair was pressed against her face  
Her eyes were red with anger  
Enraged by things unsaid, and empty beds, and bad behavior  
Something's gotta change  
It must be rearranged, oh  
  
I'm sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
It's beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world  
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right, yeah, whoa, whoa  
  
The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember  
The way it feels to be alive  
The day that he first met her  
Something's gotta change  
Things cannot stay the same  
  
You make me think of someone wonderful, but I can't place her  
I wake up every morning wishing one more time to face her  
Something's gotta change  
It must be rearranged, oh  
  
I'm sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
It's beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world  
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right  
  
So much to love  
So much to learn  
But I won't be there to teach you, oh  
I know I can be close  
But I try my best to reach you  
  
I'm so sorry  
I did not mean to hurt my little girl  
It's beyond me  
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world  
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Hope that things work out all right, yeah, whoa, oh, yeah

Put your hands all over,  
Put your hands all over me  
(Put your hands all over me)  
  
I can't seem to find  
A pretty little face I left behind  
Wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a better place to call home  
  
Gave her a place to stay  
And she got up and ran away  
And now I've had enough  
A pretty little face has torn me up

Oh  
  
Now you've lost your mind  
A pretty little girl I left behind  
And now you're getting rough  
But everybody knows you're not that tough  
  
She wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a place to call your own  
You're scared to death of the road ahead  
Pretty little thing don't get upset  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me, talk to me  
Tell me everything is gonna be alright  
(gonna be alright)  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please walk with me, walk with me now  
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away

War is over  
If you want it  
War is over now


Well I don't feel as if I know you  
You take up all my time  
The days are long and the nights will throw you away  
'Cause the sun won't shine  
  
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day  
Nobody ever seems to remember, life is a game we play  
  
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away  
And it's never gonna be the same  
'Cause the years are fallin' by like the rain  
It's never gonna be the same  
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says  
Hello  
  
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely  
They got no faith in you  
But I've got a feeling, you still owe me  
So wipe from your shoes  
  
Nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day  
Nobody ever seems to remember, the life is a game we play  
  
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away  
And it's never gonna be the same  
'Cause the years are fallin' by like the rain  
It's never gonna be the same  
Until' my mind's knew, comes to my house and says  
Hello, hello  
  
Hello, hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Hello, hello  
Oh yeah


I have been searching for your touch  
Unlike any touch I've ever known  
  
And I never thought about you much  
Till I'm broken down and all alone  
  
No I don't understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying, oh  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
I'm asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now  
I'd kill if I could take you back  
But how?  
But how?  
  
I can feel it in my guts  
What's going on with him now  
  
Don't patronize me with lies  
I'ma man, be a woman now  
  
I have been bound by the shackles of love  
And I don't mind if I die tied up  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
I'm asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now  
I'd kill if I could take you back  
But how?  
But how?  
But how?  
But how?  
  
Why must we be so ugly  
And please do not speak ill of me  
Why does the one you love  
Become the one who makes you want to cry  
  
And why?  
Why?  
Why?  
  
No I don't understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying


I must have been a fool  
To love you so hard for so long  
So much stronger than before  
But so much harder to move on  
And now the bitter chill of the winter  
Still blows through me like a plague  
Only to wake up with an empty bed  
On a perfect summer day  
  
My world just feels so cold  
And you find yourself walking down  
The wrong side of the road  
Ow!  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
I never did my best to express how I really felt  
And now that I know exactly what I want  
You found somebody else  
  
Ooh my world just feels so cold  
And you find yourself walking on  
The wrong side of the road  
Oh yeah  
  
I can't lie your on my mind stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, oh)  
(Ah la la la la la la la, yeah)  
  
My world just feels so cold  
And I find myself thinking about the things I could have done  
And it warms my soul when you let me know  
I'm not the only one  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head  
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah  
I just die so much inside now that you're not there  
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday  
  
(I can't lie your on my mind, stuck inside my head)  
(I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah)  
(I just die so much inside now that you're not there)  
(I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday)


[Verse 1]  
Wasted the more I think, the more I think about you  
But no I can't take it  
[????]  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Do your thing on me  
How we used to be  
Is it better now that I'm not around?  
Things are left astray  
Yelling out your name  
Are you happy now?  
Are you happy now?  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna know know know know  
Who's taking you home home home home  
I'm loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know know know know  
Who's taking you home home home home  
I'm loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I every time I go out  
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one  
Mentioning someone new  
Yeah  
Say I don't believe it  
I'm losing my head  
Must've been my bad  
Maybe I'm just a fool  
  
[Bridge]  
Wasted  
The more I drink, the more I'm thinking about you  
But no, I can't take it  
Maybe I should just go on without you, no  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I don't wanna know  
Who's taking you home  
I'm loving you so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know  
Who's taking you home  
I'm loving you so  
The way I used to love you, no  
  
Yeah, yeah, woah oh oh oh


They say ev'rything can be replaced,  
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.  
So I remember ev'ry face  
Of ev'ry man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say ev'ry man needs protection,  
They say ev'ry man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.


Say what you're mad at me for, me for  
Yeah why you talk that evil, yeah  
That's not the way you show love, show love  
No love, no love, no no  
Say what you're crying at me for, me for  
Try to control your ego  
That's not the way you show love, show love  
No love, no love, no no  
  
Cause I got all the things I wanna say  
But nothing's coming out  
And all the times I came to you  
But never never lied  
Show me that phone in your pocket girl  
Show me that phone in your pocket  
So wait you think that I don't know what this is really all about  
It should be really easy  
If you have nothing to hide  
Show me that phone in your pocket girl  
Show me that phone in your pocket  
  
So why you spying on me for, me for  
Tell me what you're looking for  
This shit you're saying is so low, so low  
No love, no love, no no  
But tell me where did you go, you go  
When you saying need time alone, yeah  
You really think I don't know, don't know  
I know, I know, I know  
  
Cause I got all the things I wanna say  
But nothing's coming out  
And all the times I came to you  
But never never lied

Show me that phone in your pocket  
So wait you think that I don't know what this is really all about

And said to me had nothing to hide  
Yeah  
Now you're dead to me, this really is goodbye  
  
Cause I got all the things I wanna say  
But nothing's coming out  
And all the times I came to you  
But never never lied  
Show me that phone in your pocket girl

Show me that phone in your pocket


Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial  
For something that I did not do  
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time  
I wouldn't pass right by you  
  
Maybe it's because you are so insecure  
Maybe your plain don't care  
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off  
I fall so when it's just not there  
  
Burn another bridge, break another heart  
Try again, it will only fall apart  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
It's such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
I'm touching your skin  
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?  
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)  
  
Try to put my finger on what burns me up  
It always seems to escape me  
And when you have decided that you've had enough  
Just tell me where I need to be  
  
Now her face is something that I never had  
To ever deal with before  
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough  
And I'm the one wanting more  
  
Burn another bridge, break another heart  
Try again, it will only fall apart  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
It's such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
I'm touching your skin  
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?  
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)  
  
I'm so attracted to you  
The feeling's mutual too  
And I get scared the moment you leave  
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeah  
  
Infatuation  
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me  
It's such a shame that you shot me down  
It would have been nice to be around  
I'm touching your skin  
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?  
I guess this must be infatuation (I want it)  
  
Oh (I want it)  
Oh (I want it)  
Yeah (I want it)


I won't let anyone hurt you  
And I'll stop them if they try to  
Nobody knows you like I do, ba-by  
And I don't care where you run to  
Because I'm gonna find you  
  
When the stars all align  
We can try again  
  
Is anybody out there?  
Can anybody see?  
Seems like everything's gone crazy  
You're exactly what I wanted  
And exactly what I need  
Don't need anybody but my ba-by  
  
So where did all your love go  
You play me like a solo  
Then you threw my broken heart away, yeah  
  
I know that we can make it  
And I know that you can feel me  
So stop fooling around and just stay  
  
Is anybody out there?  
Can anybody see?  
Seems like everything's gone crazy  
You're exactly what I wanted  
Exactly what I need  
I don't need anybody but my ba-by  
  
It's taken such a long time  
To find what I've been looking for  
And now that you are all mine  
I never felt quite like this before  
Still want more  
All you need in my mind  
Because if so, then you already know  
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed  
  
Is anybody out there?  
Can anybody see?  
Seems like everything's gone crazy  
You're exactly what I wanted  
And exactly what I need  
Don't need anybody but my baby


I watched you cry  
Bathed in sunlight  
By the bathroom door  
You said you wished you did not love me anymore  
  
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car  
The things we said and did have left permanent scars  
Obsessed depressed at the same time  
I can't even walk in a straight line  
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries  
This is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes  
You're not even there  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Oh yeah  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
You've hit your low  
You've lost control and you want me back  
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have  
Oh just confess that you're still mine  
I roll around in a bed full of tears and  
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries this is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes you're not even there  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
No I can't believe that it's over now baby  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
So much to say  
It's not the way she does her hair  
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes  
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away  
The love she tried so hard to save  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
It's just a feeling  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over yeah


[Neil Young cover]  
  
Colors on the street  
Red, white and blue  
People shufflin' their feet  
People sleepin' in their shoes  
But there's a warnin' sign  
On the road ahead  
There's a lot of people sayin'  
We'd be better off dead  
Don't feel like Satan,  
But I am to them  
So I try to forget it,  
Any way I can.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away,  
And she's gone to get a hit  
She hates her life,  
And what she's done to it  
There's one more kid  
That will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love,  
Never get to be cool.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
We got a kinder, gentler,  
Machine gun hand  
We got department stores  
And toilet paper  
Got styrofoam boxes  
For the ozone layer  
Got a man of the people,  
Says keep hope alive  
Got fuel to burn,  
Got roads to drive.  
  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world  
Keep on rockin' in the free world,  
Keep on rockin' in the free world.


You don't have to be beautiful  
To turn me on  
I just need your body baby  
From dusk till dawn  
You don't need experience  
To turn me out  
You just leave it all up to me  
I'm gonna show you what it's all about  
  
You don't have to be rich  
To be my girl  
You don't have to be cool  
To rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss  
  
You got to not talk dirty, baby  
If you want to impress me  
You can't be to flirty, mama  
I know how to undress me (Yeah)  
I want to be your fantasy  
Maybe you could be mine  
You just leave it all up to me  
We could have a good time  
  
You don't have to be rich  
To be my girl  
You don't have to be cool  
To rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss!  
  
Women not girls rule my world  
I said they rule my world  
Act your age, mama (Not your shoe size)  
Not your shoe size  
Maybe we could do the twirl  
You don't have to watch Dynasty  
To have an attitude  
You just leave it all up to me  
My love will be your food, yeah  
  
You don't have to be rich  
To be my girl  
You don't have to be cool  
To rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss!


You're such a flirt, I know you hurt  
And so do I, I empathize  
I see you out, you never cared  
A conversation that we never shared  
  
But it's so strange, it's something new  
Amazing feelings that I have for you  
I close my eyes when I'm alone  
Wonder what it'd be like to make you moan  
  
I wanna give you something better  
Than anything you've ever had  
A stronger and a faster lover  
The world it disappears so fast  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Don't stop it before it begins  
  
So give it up, and don't pretend  
And spread your arms and legs across the bed  
And when you shake, you won't regret  
The things I whisper in your ear  
(What?) I said  
  
I wanna give you something better  
(You wanna give me something better)  
Than anything you've ever had  
(Than anything I've ever had)  
A stronger and a faster lover  
(A stronger and a faster lover)  
The world it disappears so fast  
(It disappears so fast)  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Don't stop it before it begins  
  
I can't wait to take you home  
Fingers through your hair  
Kisses on your back  
Scratch me with your nails  
Save me from myself  
Show me how to care  
Get everything out  
Dripping everywhere  
Lipstick smeared all over your face  
How much longer must we wait?  
Don't think that I can wait  
  
Sweet Kiwi  
Your juice is dripping down my chin  
So please let me  
Don't stop it before it begins  
  
(Hey, yeah)  
  
Sweet Kiwi (wanna give you something better than this)  
Your juice is dripping down my chin (hey)  
So please let me (wanna give you something better than this)  
Don't stop it before it begins  
  
Don't stop it before it begins  
Don't stop it before it begins  
Don't stop it before it begins  
Don't stop it before it begins


Baby it's not alright  
The second that you turn your back she'll be outta sight  
Baby she'll break your heart  
The second that you spend the night apart  
How could you do it?  
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made  
How could you do it?  
Oh you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Baby she'll eat you live  
As soon as she smells your blood in the water  
You better run to survive  
Before she makes you her latest slaughter  
How could you do it?  
Oh, just come back to me, baby I'm begging please  
How could you do it?  
Oh she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller


I'm sick of picking the pieces  
And second-guessing  
My reasons why you don't trust me  
Why must we do this to one another?  
  
We are just passionate lovers  
With trouble under the covers  
Nothing worse than when  
You know that it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
I just need a little of your time  
A little of your time  
To say the words I never said  
Just need a little of your time  
A little of your time  
To show you that I am not dead  
  
Please don't leave, stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
  
Well, I've got nothing to hide  
Dip down and come for a ride  
I'm a racy devil, so sly  
You cannot hear him coming  
  
'Cause my defenses are weak  
I have no breath left to speak  
So take the evidence  
And bury it somewhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please don't leave, stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
  
Oh my, I don't mind being the other guy  
Nice try, for these games I do not have the time  
If you want me, call me  
Come and take a risk kiss  
Leave somewhere deep under the surface  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please don't leave, stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it?


It's so hard to find you  
I'm standing right behind you  
The streets are much colder  
This mean I'm getting older  
  
Why would you? How could I?  
These questions lead to goodbye  
But now I got my freedom  
Don't I?  
  
[Chorus]  
I parked my car outside your house  
Hope that someday you'll come home  
Seems the woman that I love  
Is someone that I hardly know  
And after all this time  
I've finally found a way to be alone  
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind  
  
Shy girl, so humble  
With eyes that make me stumble  
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything  
I go out, you eat in  
Hide from the situation  
You're naked in daylight  
Wrap yourself up and goodnight  
  
I'm burning, I'm hungry  
Angry 'cause she don't love me  
You've got me completely  
In my own game, you beat me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will be back again  
No this is not the end  
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in  
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget  
The tears that you shed  
I'll make it impossible to let go  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Please don't see  
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies  
Please see me  
Reaching out for someone I can't see  
  
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow  
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand  
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow  
So let's get drunk on our tears  
  
And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  
  
Who are we?  
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?  
Woe is me  
If we're not careful turns into reality  
  
But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow  
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer  
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending  
Where we're dancing in our tears  
  
And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
We're searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  
  
I thought I saw you out there crying  
I thought I heard you call my name  
I thought I heard you out there crying  
But just the same Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and this lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  
  
And I thought I saw you out there crying  
And I thought I heard you call my name  
And I thought I heard you out there crying  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?  
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?


I know your insides are feeling so hollow  
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah  
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover  
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way  
  
You're such a hard act for me to follow  
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah  
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover  
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost  
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop  
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you  
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
Take me all the way, if you take me all the way yeah


When I wake up in the morning, love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something without warning, love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
... Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day...  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day...  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day...

You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here  
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir  
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game  
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her  
  
And I can't wait another minute  
I can't take the look she's giving  
You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky  
And I don't wanna go down, go down  
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize  
She'll make me want her right now, right now  
  
And I can't wait another minute  
I can't take the look she's giving  
You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Hey, you're taking all my pain away  
You're shaking like an earthquake  
Hey, you're taking all my pain away  
You're shaking like an earthquake  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
My lucky strike, my lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million


[Verse 1]  
I miss the taste of a sweeter life,  
I miss the conversation.  
I'm searching for a song tonight,  
I'm changing all of the stations.  
I like to think that we had it all,  
We drew a map to a better place.  
But on that road, I took a fall,  
Oh baby, why did you run away?  
  
[Bridge]  
I was there for you, in your darkest times,  
I was there for you, in your darkest nights.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst , down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you  
When all the roads you took , came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do,  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I hear your voice in my sleep at night,  
Hard to resist temptation.  
'Cause something strange has come over me,  
And now I can't get over you.  
No, I just can't get over you!  
  
[Bridge]  
I was there for you, in your darkest times,  
I was there for you, in your darkest nights.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst, down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you?  
When all the roads you took, came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do,  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Ah ah ah  
  
[Hook]  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest time,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest night,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest time,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest night!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you,  
When I was at my worst, down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you?  
When all the roads you took, came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following.


Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
So scared of breaking it  
That you won't let it bend  
And I wrote two hundred letters  
I will never send  
Sometimes these cuts are so much  
Deeper then they seem  
You'd rather cover up  
I'd rather let them bleed  
So let me be  
And I'll set you free  
  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why won't you answer me?  
The silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
Your salty skin and how  
It mixes in with mine  
The way it feels to be  
Completely intertwined  
It's not that I didn't care  
It's that I didn't know  
It's not what I didn't feel,  
It's what I didn't show  
So let me be  
And I'll set you free  
  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why won't you answer me?  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
You say your faith is shaken  
You may be mistaken  
You keep me wide awake and  
Waiting for the sun  
I'm desperate and confused  
So far away from you  
I'm getting there  
Don't care where I have to run  
  
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah  
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah  
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah  
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah  
  
I am in misery  
There ain't nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why won't you answer me?  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
I'm gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
(Girl you really got me bad)  
(You really got me bad)  
(I'm gonna get you back)  
(Gonna get you back)


This has not been easy  
This has been hard  
I am scarred  
And I do not know what to do with you.  
  
Go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips  
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this  
  
But I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no  
I don't need you tonight  
  
Who do you think you are?  
No one cares about a name without a face  
So don't go shooting up the place  
Make no mistake, your love's not real  
'Cause the love that I've got is deeper, so much deeper than you could ever
feel  
  
And I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you cant stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no  
'Cause I don't need you tonight  
  
It was really nice to know you  
But, there's nothing left to show you  
I got bills to pay, get out the way, it's time to move on  
And dinner with your boyfriend, will never be the same again  
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him  
  
I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me  
To kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again  
So oh no, 'cause I don't need you  
And I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to  
Kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again  
So no no, 'cause I won't need you


Just shoot for the stars if it feels right  
And aim for my heart if you feel like it  
Take me away and make it okay  
I swear I'll behave  
  
You wanted control so we waited  
I put on a show now we're naked  
You say I'm a kid my ego is big  
I don't give a shit and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
Baby it's hard when you feel like  
You're broken and scarred  
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me  
I make you believe that I've got the key  
  
Oh, so get in the car we can ride it  
Wherever you want get inside it  
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear  
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
You want to know how to make me smile  
Take control, own me just for the night  
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
So watch and learn I won't show you twice  
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right  
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
And it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger


I've been the needle and the thread  
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head  
I try to laugh but cry instead  
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said  
  
Fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lifting you up  
I'm letting you down  
I'm dancing till dawn  
I'm fooling around  
I'm not giving up  
I'm making your love  
This city's made us crazy and we must get out  
  
"This is not goodbye," she said,  
"It's just time for me to rest my head."  
She does not walk, she runs instead  
Down these jagged streets and into my bed  
  
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer  
Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's only so much I can do for you  
After all of the things you've put me through  
  
[Chorus]


I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story  
About this lovely girl who's name was Jane  
She was vast and deep and filled with glory  
Aaaahhhh  
Bottom served as home for hull and anchor  
She's always fit to quarrel with the wind  
The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her  
Aaaahhhh  
Then she heard me  
Say that oath that  
Made everything clear  
I love you  
My ocean blue  
I like the way your sea sees me  
My darling Jane  
She speaks to me at times through falling rain  
Now twas time to manifest her vigor  
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?  
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger  
Aaaaahhhh  
Then she heard me  
Say that oath that  
Made everything clear  
I love you  
My ocean blue  
I like the way your sea sees me  
My darling Jane  
Oh me, my darling Jane  
Oh me and my darling Jane  
She speaks to me at times through falling rain  
Speaks to me at times through falling rain


I know you're scared  
I can feel it

You push me, I don't have the strength to  
Resist or control you  
So take me down  
Take me down  
  
You hurt me, but do I deserve this  
You make me so nervous  
Calm me down  
Calm me down  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,  
I will never walk away again  
I never gonna leave this bed  
  
So come here and never leave this place  
Perfection of your face  
Slows me down  
Slows me down  
So fall down I need you to trust me  
Go easy, don't rush me  
  
Help me out why don't you help me out  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,  
I will never walk away again  
I never gonna leave this bed  
You say go  
It isn't worth it and I say no  
It isn't perfect so I stay and still  
I'm never gonna leave this bed uh  
  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
I'd give it all away just to get you back  
And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get  
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?  
Try to stay awake but you can't forget  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,  
I will never walk away again  
I'm never gonna leave this bed  
Oh, you say go  
It isn't worth it and I say no  
It isn't perfect so I stay and still  
I'm never gonna leave this bed uh  
  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have  
Take it, take it all take all that I have


The family life it was divine  
She sat alone with tired eyes  
patiently listening to the sighs  
  
I found out  
I found out  
She never has the time  
I found out  
to make his demons  
  
They snatched her willingly she left  
They wondered why she'd accepted that  
She knew that she'd be saved but how  
She knew that future kid was on the prowl  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
me and future's child  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
Me and future's child  
I found out  
Never's far too long  
for me to sing this song


You say you need someone  
But everybody does  
I'm no different than you  
I just believe what I do  
  
You point your finger at  
Everyone but yourself  
And blame the ones that you love  
Who are only trying to help  
  
As it's winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
I'll see this through  
There's so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Five, four, three, two, one I won't stop until it's done  
No curtain call, I will not fall  
This may be the one we've been waiting for  
No curtain call, just take it all  
  
I have no time for fear  
Or people in my ear  
Head down and running so fast  
Try not to dwell on the past  
  
I'm fighting through this pain  
And things I cannot change  
Running right into the flame  
Rather than running away  
  
As it's winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
I'll see this through  
There's so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sweat drips down from every angle  
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet  
You turn up the heat  
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep  
Quietly weep, you're in too deep  
  
[Chorus: x2]


When you refuse me  
You confuse me  
What makes you think I'll let you in again  
Think again, my friend  
Go on, misuse me and abuse me  
I'll come out stronger in the end  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
I'll bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
[Chorus]  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
You do not know how much this hurts me  
To say these things that I don't want to say  
But I have to say them anyway  
I would do anything to end your suffering  
But you would rather walk away  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
I'll bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
  
Does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
Does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
Bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home


Your wind blows  
Your mind falls down  
Just give me  
The time to drown  
  
Your wind blows  
Your mind falls down  
Just give me  
The time to drown  
  
The boys are  
Digging the ground  
But I can't stop spinning around  
  
One day you will let me be  
What I wanted you to be  
  
The boys are  
Stopping the ground  
From taking  
Those things we found  
Someday you will let me see  
All of the things we used to see  
  
Someday you will let me be  
All of the things we used to be  
Someday you will let me be  
The champ you wanted her to see


I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,  
The people we used to be  
It's even harder to picture,  
That you're not here next to me  
  
You say it's too late to make it,  
But is it too late to try?  
And in our time that you wasted  
All of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my nights,  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed,  
Still stuck in that time,  
When we called it love,  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song , I'll be sick  
  
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow  
'Cause you forgot yesterday  
I gave you my love to borrow,  
But you just gave it away  
  
You can't expect me to be fine,  
I don't expect you to care  
I know I've said it before,  
But all of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my nights,  
You turned out the lights  
Now I'm paralyzed,  
Still stuck in that time,  
When we called it love,  
But even the sun sets in paradise  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick  
Now I'm at a payphone  
  
Man, fuck that shit  
I'll be out spending all this money  
While you're sitting round wondering  
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,  
Made it from the bottom  
Now when you see me I'm stunting,  
And all of my cars start with a push of a button  
  
Telling me the chances I blew up  
Or whatever you call it,  
Switch the number to my phone  
So you never could call it,  
Don't need my name on my show,  
You can tell it I'm ballin'  
  
Swish, what a shame could have got picked  
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot  
So you talk about who you see at the top  
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for  
Phantom pulled up valet open doors  
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for  
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take  
that little piece of shit with you  
  
I'm at a payphone trying to call home  
All of my change I spent on you  
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong  
Where are the plans we made for two?  
  
If "Happy Ever Afters" did exist,  
I would still be holding you like this  
All those fairy tales are full of shit  
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick  
Now I'm at a payphone


Rag Doll  
How ya feelin'?  
The day has had its way with both of us  
And no, I've gone out of my way  
But I'm not free  
From this pain I'm reelin'  
I was a fool to think some day you would come around  
But no no no I'm not thinking that way  
'Cause now I see  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
There's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
How's your day been?  
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns  
But no no no I feel better today  
'Cause I'm off my knees  
  
You are not what you seem  
You are a mystery to me  
Sometimes I just wanna scream  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
There's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you can't come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows, lock my doors  
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore  
Yeah  
  
I think you should just go away cause  
there's no necessity for you to stay and  
Next time you come around my way  
Forget it baby your not comin' in  
  
A heart made for a lot of sorrow  
No you can't come back tomorrow  
Shut my windows, lock my doors  
'Cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore  
Whoa


What am I supposed to do with this time  
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm  
Feel out of control, so petrified  
I'm petrified  
  
What am I supposed to do to get by  
Did I lose everything I need to survive  
'Cause its 4 a.m. and the sweat sets in  
Did you get my message, did it send  
Or did you just get on with your life, oh  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling when I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
What am I supposed to do with these clothes  
It's my twisted way of keep you close  
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man  
Did you get my message, did it send  
Or do you get along on your own, oh  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling when I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
And it breaks me down when I see your face  
You look so different but you feel the same  
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend  
The chills your body sends, why did it have to end  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
I have this feeling that I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
I've taken time to think and I  
Don't think it's fair for us to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
And I have this feeling that I  
Finally found the words to say  
But I can't tell you  
If you turn around and run away, run away  
  
Runaway, runaway  
Turn around and runaway, runaway  
Runaway, runaway  
But I can't tell you if you runaway, runaway  
Turn around and runaway


Man, it's been a long day  
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway  
Wondering if I really tried everything I could  
Not knowing if I should try a little harder  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
I'm so sad, sad  
  
Man, it's been a long night  
Just sitting here trying not to look back  
Still looking at the road we never drove on  
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
I'm so sad, sad  
  
So sad, so sad  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
  
And I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
I'm so sad, so sad


Watch the sunrise  
Say your goodbyes  
Off we go  
Some conversation  
No contemplation  
Hit the road  
  
Car overheats  
Jump out of my seat  
On the side of the highway, baby  
Our road is long  
Your hold is strong  
Please don't ever let it go, oh no  
  
I know I don't know you  
But I want you so bad  
Everyone has a secret  
Oh, can they keep it  
Oh, no they can't  
  
Driving fast now  
Don't think I know how to go slow  
Where you at now  
I feel around  
There you are  
  
Cool these engines  
Calm these jets  
I ask you, how hot can it get?  
As you wipe off beads of sweat  
Slowly, you say, I'm not there yet  
  
I know I don't know you  
But I want you so bad  
Everyone has a secret  
Oh, can they keep it  
Oh, no they can't  
  
I know I don't know you  
But I want you so bad  
Everyone has a secret  
But can they keep it  
Oh, no they can't


Beauty queen of only eighteen she  
Had some trouble with herself  
He was always there to help her, she  
Always belonged to someone else  
  
I drove for miles and miles and wound up  
At your door  
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  
  
I don't mind spendin' everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved, and she will be loved  
  
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I  
Want to make you feel beautiful  
I know I tend to get so insecure  
It doesn't matter anymore  
  
It's not always rainbows and butterflies  
It's compromise that moves us along yeah  
My heart is full, and my door's always open  
You can come anytime you want yeah  
  
I don't mind spendin' everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved, and she will be loved  
And she will be loved, and she will be loved  
  
I know where you hide alone in your car  
Know all of the things that make you who you are  
I know that goodbye means nothing at all  
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she  
Falls  
  
Yeah, tap on my window, knock on my door, I  
Want to make you feel beautiful  
  
I don't mind spendin' everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain oh  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved, and she will be loved  
And she will be loved, and she will be loved  
  
Please don't try so hard to say good-bye  
I don't mind spendin' everyday, out on your corner in the pourin' rain  
Please don't try so hard to say good-bye


We filled the day with careless displays  
Going sailing with nothing to say  
When I fell  
We could tell  
  
Now you're torn apart  
The sun's driving fast  
Taking photographs  
It's morning at last  
And the sailors are taking a stand  
With their heads buried deep in the sand  
  
Feeling well  
Life is swell  
When I fell  
We could tell  
Hooray  
When I fell  
We could tell  
Feeling well  
Life is swell


The crowd was getting old  
The disco's back or so I'm told  
But we've got nothing here  
Except a tired set of ears and we say  
  
Hey mama, I'm something  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
The children had the time  
To overthrow the slime  
The superchildren said they could see  
  
Bright lights and clean colors  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
Bright lights and clean colors  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
Hey mama, I'm something  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view


Do you mean all the things you are?  
Are you pleased with the way things are?  
Wear that dress to protect this scar  
That only I have seen  
  
Do you give just to please yourself?  
Do you wish you were somewhere else?  
Justified all the things you tried  
Said that it was all for me  
  
And be near  
Just for the moment  
Stay here  
Never go home  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true  
It comes true  
  
Have you learned all the secrets yet?  
Will you burn by the things I've said?  
Took the dive just to feel alive  
But never heard the truth  
  
Now I'm in love but I don't know how  
I'm in pain cause I want it now  
As I sit watching her eyes close  
I slowly open mine  
  
And be near  
Just for the moment  
Stay here  
Never go home  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  
So it goes, the story of a broken heart comes true, comes true  
  
I am so confused by this  
I know that life is hit or miss  
Days are stung by too much sun  
I think that you may be the one  
  
Cover yourself up in me  
Shrouded in what could have been  
I will listen to your pain  
If you listen to me  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  
So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?  
And I know, the story of a broken heart comes true  
Come true  
True  
It comes true  
True

[Verse 1]  
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down  
I need your loving, loving I need it now  
When I'm without you, I'm something weak  
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't wanna be needing your love  
I just wanna be deep in your love  
And it's killing me when you're away  
Oh baby  
Cause I really don't care where you are  
I just wanna be there where you are  
And I gotta get one little taste  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy

Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Verse 2]

Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some  
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure  
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't wanna be needing your love  
I just wanna be deep in your love  
And it's killing me when you're away  
Oh baby  
Cause I really don't care where you are  
I just wanna be there where you are  
And I gotta get one little taste  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Bridge]  
I want that red velvet  
I want that sugar sweet  
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me  
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way  
Cause girl you're hotter than the Southern California Bay  
And I wanna play no games, and you don't gotta be be afraid  
Don't give me all that shy shit  
No make-up on, that's my sugar  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?


Sunday morning, rain is falling  
Steal some covers, share some skin  
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable  
You twist to fit the mold that I am in  
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do  
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew  
That someday it would lead me back to you  
That someday it would lead me back to you  
  
That may be all I need  
In darkness, she is all I see  
Come and rest your bones with me  
Driving slow on Sunday morning  
And I never want to leave  
  
Fingers trace your every outline  
Paint a picture with my hands  
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm  
Change the weather, still together when it ends  
  
That may be all I need  
In darkness, she is all I see  
Come and rest your bones with me  
Driving slow on Sunday morning  
And I never want to leave  
  
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do  
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you  
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.  
Find a way to bring myself back home to you  
  
That may be all I need  
In darkness, she is all I see  
Come and rest your bones with me  
Driving slow on Sunday morning  
Driving slow  
  
It's flower in your hair  
I'm a flower in your hair


Where you are seems to be  
As far as an eternity  
Outstretched arms, open hearts  
And if it never ends then when do we start?  
I'll never leave you behind  
Or treat you unkind  
I know you understand  
And with a tear in my eye  
Give me the sweetest goodbye  
That I ever did receive  
  
[Chorus]  
Pushing forward and arching back  
Bring me closer to heart attack  
Say goodbye and just fly away  
When you come back  
I have some things to say  
  
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone  
When you get home  
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go  
So I can show you how I  
  
Dream away everyday  
Try so hard to disregard  
The rhythm of the rain that drops  
And coincides with the beating of my heart  
  
I'll never leave you behind  
Or treat you unkind  
I know you understand  
And with a tear in my eye  
Give me the sweetest goodbye  
That I ever did receive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone  
When you get home  
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go  
So I can show you how I feel


I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I  
Walked into the living room  
Sit with you, discuss what's going on  
Is it me?  
Is it you?  
Is it something I forgot to do?  
Tell me so that I understand  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me, given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me  
  
I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon  
Even my worst enemy  
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?  
Is it me?  
Is it you?  
Is it something I forgot to do?  
Tell me so that I understand  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me


I'm full of regret  
For all the things that I have done and said  
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show  
My face 'round here  
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  
  
Would you ever turn your head and look  
To see if I'm gone  
'Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]  
There is nothing left to say to you  
That you want to hear  
That you want to know  
I think I should go  
The things I've done are way too shameful  
  
You're just an innocent  
A helpless victim of a spider's web  
And I'm an insect  
Going after anything that I can get  
So you'd better turn your head and run  
And don't look back  
Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I have done you so wrong  
Treated you bad  
Strung you along  
Oh, shame on myself  
I don't know how I got so tangled up  
'Cause I fear  
  
[Chorus]


She was a bad thing coming,  
But I did not know.  
And everytime I came over she told me I had to go.  
I said "Hey, what's going on? I really want to know."  
She said "I cannot tell you now, but I'll call you tomorrow."  
That's not enough.  
I want more.  
I want it all.  
I want to bang on your front door.  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world.  
Cause at the end of the day,  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Yeah  
She's snake me with sophisication,  
So much class.  
She drinks a Santa margarita,  
Would you like a glass?  
I don't know how to say no  
And after three or four,  
I was on the floor,  
Singing my song,  
La la la  
No no.  
That's not enough.  
I want more.  
I want it all.  
I want to bang on your front door.  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world.  
Cause at the end of the day,  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Yeah...  
La la la.  
No no.  
That's not enough.  
I want more.  
I want it all.  
I want to bang on your front door.  
Turn off the lights  
And shut out the world.  
Cause at the end of the day,  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Aren't we all just boys and girls? (all just boys and girls)  
Oh yeah. Oh  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Aren't we all just boys and girls?  
Yeah... Oh.


Here in this town they have all got the blues  
As the paper boy takes off without any news  
Angels have wings you can feel free to use  
The corner store drugs you can freely abuse  
  
And I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy  
  
So life on your own has been vacant and cold  
Everyone's getting somewhere and you're getting old  
Career opportunities they all have been sold  
Along with your body and most of your soul  
  
And I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy  
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe  
Cause the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast  
The chaos is building, it's going too last  
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes  
Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens  
When you start frowning they think you're obscene  
As you work overtime to make sure they can dream  
  
I'm yelling and screaming cause baby you're driving me crazy  
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe  
Cause the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast  
The chaos is building, it's going too last  
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
And we yell and we scream  
As the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast  
The chaos is building, it's going to last  
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
And the fog's getting thicker the world's spinning fast  
The chaos is building, it's going to last  
And it's so hard to see and you're so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind


As we kicked around downtown waiting for the sun to rise  
we watched the clouds  
take the shape of a chevrolet  
and the way that I'm feeling is the color of my lover's eyes  
she caught me lookin' the other way  
thinkin' finally of our better days  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
don't know how long we'll be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
and we'll be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck  
  
Trippin' on a flat tire  
dial up the triple A  
time is running out for our escape  
so much for that chevrolet  
eyes shut tight as we venture to another place  
as we listen to the music play  
I can't remember what I had to say  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
don't know how long we'll be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
and we'll be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck  
  
As she climbs her way  
up to the top of me  
we look down on everyone  
and we proclaim that we  
don't know how long we'll be  
as we kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
kiss the world goodbye  
0and we'll be gone  
into the sky and out of our minds  
watch the faces and buildings and cars getting smaller with time  
wish us luck


In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other  
Like oh oh oh, can't take it anymore  
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy  
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other  
Like, oh oh oh it isn't funny anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah  
  
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy  
Happy ever after, happy ever after  
Let it go, you never need to know  
I don't wanna be picking up all of these  
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces  
Of your heart, won't do it anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
  
I was the  
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other, screaming  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
  
I was the man who never lied  
Never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh (oh I was the man)  
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah (I was the man oh yeah)


After school  
Walking home  
Fresh dirt under my fingernails  
And I can smell hot asphalt  
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass  
And I cannot remember  
What life was like through photographs  
Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  
  
And sometimes it's a sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
But I cannot forget  
Refuse to regret  
So glad I met you and  
Take my breath away  
Make everyday  
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through  
And Mama I've been cryin'  
Cause things ain't how they used to be  
She said, "The battle's almost won  
And we're only several miles from the sun."  
  
Moving on down my street  
I see people I won't ever meet  
Think of her, take a breath  
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps  
  
And sometimes it's a sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The rhythm of her conversation  
The perfection of her creation  
The sex she slipped into my coffee  
The way she felt when she first saw me  
Hate to love and love to hate her  
Like a broken record player  
Back and forth and here and gone  
And on and on and on and on  
  
[Chorus]


I was so high, I did not recognize  
The fire burning in her eyes  
The chaos that controlled my mind  
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane  
Never to return again  
But always in my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
This love has taken it's toll on me  
She said goodbye too many times before  
And her heart is breaking in front of me  
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore  
  
I tried my best to feed her appetite  
Keep her coming every night  
So hard to keep her satisfied  
Kept playing love like it was just a game  
Pretending to feel the same  
Then turn around and leave again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll fix these broken things  
Repair your broken wings  
And make sure everything is alright  
My pressure on your hips  
Sinking my fingertips  
Into every inch of you  
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do  
  
[Chorus]


Can you see me  
Floating above your head  
As you lay in bed  
Thinking about everything  
That you did not do  
Cause saying I love you  
Has nothing to do with meaning it  
  
And I don't trust you  
Cause every time you're here  
Your intentions are unclear  
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call  
That I know will never come  
I used to think you were the one  
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all  
  
[Chorus]  
You ain't ever coming back to me  
That's not how things were supposed to be  
You take my hand just to give it back  
No other lover has ever done that  
  
Do you remember  
The way we used to melt  
Do you remember how it felt  
When I touched you  
Cause I remember very well  
  
And how long has it been  
Since someone you let in  
Has given when I gave to you  
  
And at night when you sleep  
Do you dream I would be there  
Just for a minute or two  
Do you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heartache, heartache I just have so much  
A simple love with a complex touch  
There is nothing you can say or do  
I called to let you know I'm through with you


See my dear I'm thinking of you  
My how she has grown  
Her building blocks have all gone home  
And being there is always where  
I'll be  
You'll see  
  
Take your doll  
House dreams and make them real  
I've seen the sun  
I'll guide your  
Inspirations along  
And don't let them stop you from being someone's friend  
Don't bend  
  
I hope you  
Always keep your hand this close to mine  
And I hope you  
Never hesitate to wonder why  
Wonder why  
Wonder why  
If you need a shoulder mine is here  
And I love you  
And no one can tell you what to do  
And roses and diamonds could never take  
The place  
Of your face  
I hope you  
Never hesitate to wonder why  
Wonder why  
Wonder why


This relationship is over,  
Though my stomach still hurts.  
And now I'm gonna live alone,  
Why is the pain much worse?  
You're so much better without makeup,  
Why would you hide your face?  
Don't want to spend the night and wake up,  
Realize I've made a big mistake.  
  
[Chorus]  
I can not refuse your eyes,  
Please don't look at me tonight.  
My heart beats fast I know you're there,  
And I pretend like I don't care.  
It hurts so bad to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.  
  
I never meant to keep you waiting,  
And now your food is getting cold,  
I keep denying I'm in love with you,  
My routine is getting old.  
And now you stand in front of the table,  
And say you never look back.  
Your super stupid when you're angry,  
You only wake up sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.  
  
No more kisses on your lips, tender touch oh please,  
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees.  
And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be  
And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me.  
  
I can not refuse your eyes,  
Please don't look at me tonight.  
My heart beats fast I know you're there,  
And I pretend like I don't care.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It hurts too much to know the truth,  
But I am still in love with you.


Slow is the memory  
I can picture her standing right in front of me  
I said that I'm behaving badly  
Kinda driving her crazy  
But I know she wants me  
  
I remember everything  
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane  
And sit on top of me, yelling out my fucking name  
Until I'm empty  
And I know she wants me  
  
But I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
Whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
And I'll see you when I get back  
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track  
You touch me there because you know how much I like that  
I think that we both need to relax  
You know you want me  
  
All the time and everywhere  
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there  
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care  
And the emptiness is too much to bear  
  
But I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do  
I'm standing, standing right in front of you  
And pray our pain subsides  
Can't bare the stare of your teary eyes  
I know you feel like it's hard to stay  
In fact you may just wanna run away  
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh  
Deep down you know that  
  
I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
I'm sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
I have already tried to explain myself  
It's not that I love someone else  
But I can't bear to listen to you cry  
Sick of all these wasted years  
Drown in someone else's tears  
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
(We tried, yeah)

I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do  
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?  
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page  
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you  
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse  
We can turn this around please let me be first  
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt  
Something isn't right I don't wanna fight you  
  
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you  
I know that I'm causing you pain too  
But remember if you need to cry  
I'm here to wipe your eyes  
  
Tonight before you fall asleep  
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)  
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes  
I know I made you feel this way  
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)  
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes  
  
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah  
'Cause I'm here to wipe your eyes  
Oh nah nah oh nah nah nah nah  
  
When did we cross the line?  
How could we forget?  
Why do we let the pressure get into our heads?  
Your broken heart requires all of my attention  
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you  
  
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you  
I know that I'm causing you pain too

That I won't let you down  
I won't let you down  
I'm here to wipe your eyes  
  
Tonight before you fall asleep  
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)  
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes  
I know I made you feel this way  
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)  
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes


If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you  
Would you tell me  
That the time just isn't right  
And if i ever find the key you hide so well  
Will you tell me  
That I can spend the night  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Yeah ow wow  
  
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me  
I would keep them  
In a jar next to my bed  
And if i should ever draw a picture of a woman  
It is you  
That would come flowing through my pen  
  
Leaving your clothes on the floor  
Making me walk out the door  
And i still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Ow  
  
Helplessly melting  
As i stand next to the sun  
As you burn me  
I am screaming out for more  
Drink every drop of liquid  
In the heat that I've become  
Pop me open  
Spoon me out onto the floor  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
Fail to understand  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Yeah
