Lately I've been sleeping  
Far too long in bed  
I've been dreaming of you lover  
Oh the things inside my head  
  
I don't want to wake up  
I'm scared to break the spell  
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby  
I hope you sleep so well  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
  
[Bridge]  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us,  
Been on our minds  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us,  
We're gonna find  
  
[Chorus]  
I know there's a dream for us  
I believe it's true  
In a word, love you  
And I'm hoping our dream comes true  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star  
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre  
I see familiar faces, or is it deja vu  
The one recurring vision  
Is a dream I have of you  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
(Repeat bridge)  
Come on now baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you find someone you find someone you love  
You know you can't believe it  
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it  
Your love takes you high  
  
I know there's a dream for us  
I'm sure there's a dreams for us  
  
[Chorus]


Giving up on love  
Giving up on love  
  
I was so crazy about you, everyone knew  
I couldn't sleep when I found out, yeah  
You feel the way you do  
So maybe it's my turn now  
to show you how I feel  
  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings I can't conceal  
  
I'm giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
Giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
  
I don't believe that you need me  
So don't say you do  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We both know we're through  
  
So don't try and stop me now  
'Cause all we had has gone  
(All we had has gone)  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings are oh so strong  
  
I'm giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
Giving up on love  
'Cause I've been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I don't want you no more  
  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
Giving up, giving up, giving up on love  
  
So don't try and stop me now  
'Cause all we had has gone  
(All we had has gone)  
So listen to what I say  
'Cause these feelings are oh so strong


Said I love you a thousand times  
You don't betray your feelings  
But I can read the signs  
  
Stars are shining on a sea of tears  
I show my true emotions  
I have felt for all these years  
  
You cannot tell me  
That it's got to end this way  
There's nothing more to say  
  
[Bridge:]  
I just can't believe  
That you'll walk on out that door  
When I need you more and more  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again  
After promising to be  
Just good friends  
  
You say you need me, but you turn away  
I've got to show you how I feel  
I've got to make you stay  
  
You cannot tell me  
That it's got to end this way  
There's nothing more to say  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]


If you really love him  
And there's nothing I can do  
Don't try to spare my feelings  
Just tell me that we're through  
  
And make it easy on yourself  
Make it easy on yourself  
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do  
  
And if the way I hold you  
Can't compare to his caress  
No words of consolation  
Will make me miss you less  
  
My darling, if this is goodbye  
I just know I'm gonna cry  
So run to him  
Before you start crying too  
  
And make it easy on yourself  
Make it easy on yourself  
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do  
  
Oh, baby, it's so hard to do  
Breaking up is so very hard to do


She comes home in the morning light  
Tries to hide the secret of last night  
Tells a tale of working late  
Says the things she knows I hate  
Why should I convince myself  
That she loves me and no one else  
Feels like time to break the chains  
I wont be fooled again  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah  
  
When we kiss there's no flame  
But I believe I'm not to blame  
When we touch its by mistake  
Tenderness she just can't fake  
Who does she think I am  
To let her love another man  
I won't take another day  
I just refuse to stay  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah  
  
Oh I love her I really care  
The days so long when she's not there  
But I believe it just ain't right  
To see her with someone else tonight  
Hear me now  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah


Everybody needs a woman in their life  
A mother or a sister, a man may need a wife  
If you have a woman in your life  
Don't take her for granted you'll regret it by and by  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't use her or abuse her, or you'll lose her  
She filled with emotion, strong as the sea  
Deep as an ocean, and she'll always be  
So high on her feelings, high on my list  
She's everything, she is nature's gift  
  
Give her the attention that she's worthy of  
Show her some respect  
And don't take advantage of the fact that she loves you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Someone you can count on,  
She'll always be there whenever you need her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Weary from giving so much of herself  
Never complaining, always seems  
So high on her feeling, so high on my list  
She's everything she is nature's gift


It Was An Ordinary Night  
At Least It Started Out That Way  
Two Ordinary People  
Sharing Thoughts At The End Of The Day  
  
Was It The Wine That Made Her Sparkle Made Her Shine  
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be  
  
A One Night Stand  
Here I Am With Empty Hands  
Wasn't Looking For Love And I Knew From The Start  
It Was A One Night Stand  
  
She Was Only Passing Through  
But It Suited Me Just Fine  
Emotional Attachment Never Crossed My Mind  
  
Was It The Light That Played A Trick On My Mind  
I Crossed That Line It Was Only Meant To Be  
  
She Was Only Passing Through


Sitting On The Balcony Sipping On Her Herbal Tea  
That's Juliet, Juliet  
Talking On Her Mobile Phone Doesn't Like To Be Alone  
That's Juliet, Juliet  
And If She Won't Hang Up Or Put Down That Cup  
How's That Girl Ever Gonna Know  
That Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Wishing Her Life Away Nothing Left For Me To Say  
About Juliet, Juliet  
I Don't Wanna Know Let The Poison Steel The Show  
For Juliet, Juliet  
And If She Can't See The Wood For The Trees  
How's That Girl Ever Gonna Know  
That Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Love Keeps No Time But Life Slips Through Your Fingers  
Love Has No Design But It's Memory Lingers  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo Loves Juliet  
  


The love has gone  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing  
And I can feel you in my arms  
No one can know just how I'm feeling  
Knowing that our love can come to no harm  
  
But as I open my eyes  
Then I start to realize  
That you're gone and I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
What have I done girl, to make you leave me  
Didn't I love you for all those years  
  
If you open your eyes  
Baby, then you'll realize  
That you're wrong, and I can't go on  
You know I can't go on  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
  
Nothing will ever come between us  
If you will just take me back once more  
I'll show you just how much I love you  
If you'll just come walking through that door  
  
The love has gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone, will we ever be the same  
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain


If there's anything you need  
All you have to do is say  
You know you satisfy everything in me  
We shouldn't waste a single day  
  
So don't stop me falling  
It's destiny calling  
A power I just can't deny  
It's never changing  
Can't you hear me, I'm saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
Together forever and never to part  
Together forever we two  
And don't you know  
I would move heaven and earth  
To be together forever with you  
  
If they ever get you down  
There's always something I can do  
Because I wouldn't ever want to see you frown  
I'll always do what's best for you  
  
There ain't no mistaking  
It's true love we're making  
Something to last for all time  
It's never changing  
Can't you hear me, I'm saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't stop me falling  
It's destiny calling  
A power I just can't deny  
It's never changing  
Can't you hear me, I'm saying  
I want you for the rest of my life  
  
[Chorus]


What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
It's the only thing that there's just too little of.  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
No, not just for some but for everyone.  
  
Lord, we don't need another mountain,  
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb,  
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross,  
Enough to last 'till the end of time.  
  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
It's the only thing that there's just too little of.  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
No, not just for some but for everyone.  
  
Lord, we don't need another meadow,  
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow,  
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine,  
Oh listen Lord, if you want to know, oh  
  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
It's the only thing that there's just too little of.  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love,  
No, not just for some oh but just for every, every, everyone.  
  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love.  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love.  
What the world needs now,  
Is love, sweet love.


Don't know what you've got  
Not till you lose it  
You had my love but you only abused it  
I've had enough of all your excuses and lies  
  
You can look but don't you touch  
You played around girl, much too much  
You had it all but you gave it up  
It's too late  
  
What you see is what you don't get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now it's time to forget  
What you see is what you can't have  
You're missing out and that is too bad  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all you've got is regret  
  
I made up my mind, showed your true colors  
One of a kind? No you're just like the others  
I'm saying goodbye to all your excuses and lies  
And now there's nothing left to say  
So why are you standing in my way?  
And don't go begging me to stay, it's too late  
  
What you see is what you don't get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now it's time to forget  
What you see is what you can't have  
You're missing out and that is too bad  
  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all you've got is regret  
What you see is what you don't get  
Are you a fool or have you got it yet?  
You had it all and then you threw it all away


[Rick]  
Love is a special thing  
It means more to me than just a wedding ring  
When two people join as one  
They don't know just what has begun  
  
It comes to love, honor, cherish and obey  
You promised, girl, that you would not go away  
  
When you gonna come back home, girl?  
You know I'm all alone, girl  
When you gonna come back home?  
When you gonna come back home, girl?  
You know I'm all alone, girl  
When you gonna come back home?  
  
[Lisa]  
Love is a precious thing  
So, can't you see the joy that it can bring?  
So, how can you be so cruel?  
You've gone and broken every rule  
  
You promised to love, honor, cherish and obey  
You promised me you'd never go away  
  
When you gonna stay at home, boy?  
You see I was alone, boy  
When you gonna stay at home?  
When you gonna stay at home, boy?  
You see I was alone, boy  
When you gonna stay at home?  
  
[Rick]  
Love's got a hold on me  
I need you, girl, can't you see?  
  
[Lisa]  
So, why don't we spend some time?  
Let's get together, maybe we could find...  
  
[Rick and Lisa]  
We've got to love, honor, cherish and obey  
We've got to promise that we'll never go away  
  
Never gonna leave you home, no  
Leave you all alone  
Now I'm gonna stay at home  
Never gonna be alone, no  
You see I should have known  
Never gonna leave you home  
  
Never gonna leave you home, no  
Leave you all alone  
Now I'm gonna stay at home  
Never gonna be alone, no  
You see I should have known  
Never gonna leave you home


Astley  
I went home for the weekend  
I saw my friends and my family  
I couldn't believe how they'd changed  
They where laughing and crying  
Feeling all the joy in life  
It was so good to feel it too  
And I know just how it feels  
I know just what it means  
(Chorus)  
When you love someone, it feels so right  
When you love someone, they hold you tight  
When you love someone, it feels so good  
When you love someone, it's understood  
A couple having a baby  
Are giving life to the love they feel  
They count the days expectantly  
And they, they know just how it feels  
Yeah they do, and they, they know just what it means  
Just what it means  
(Repeat chorus)  
It's just about time for a change  
It's just about time for me to rearrange  
Just about time for a change  
It's just about time for me to rearrange my life  
(Repeat chorus)  
  


I'll bring my love to you  
I'll bring my love to you  
  
I've been stood up messed around  
And taken for a fool  
But next time round  
I'm gonna change the rules  
  
And I don't care about the things that people say  
It's you I think about each and everyday  
It's much too late for you to change your ways  
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay  
  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
Lost inside your love is where I want to be  
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me  
Time and time you say you want to be free  
And you can have some fun that's okay with me  
  
You will never know just how good I feel  
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I'll bring my love to you  
I just want to be with you  
  
It's much too late for you to change your ways  
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]


come home a little late at night  
And I crawl into my bed  
I think of you and where you are tonight  
And I wish you were here instead  
  
I really want you to know that I'm the one  
I'm never letting go  
I swear I'll do the best I can to be  
Your one and only man cause  
  
[Chorus]  
You light up my night and day  
You bring on the sunshine  
You make me feel good today  
Yeah you wonderful you  
  
When times are hard and nothing goes my way  
And I wonder what to do  
I think of you and all the things you say  
You're the one that pulls me through  
  
I really want you to know that I'm the one  
I'm never letting go  
I swear I'll do the best I can to be  
Your true and only man cause  
  
[Chorus]


I go to work in my clean shirt  
I push a pen until half past ten  
I watch the clock there on the wall  
Tic toc, why don't you call  
The boss comes in and walks down the aisles  
He turns around but he never smiles  
He watches me just like a hawk  
And then he says we must talk  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
Son, he says (what) I've got bad news  
Life is hard and you got the blues  
I know you're good I know you work hard  
I'm sorry, son, here are your cards  
I went home and kicked off my shoes  
And asked myself why do I always lose  
But then you rang and everything was fine  
I'm so glad that you are mine  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You're the one thing in my life  
That makes me feel so good inside  
Will you hold me tight tonight  
Oh, girl I wish you would decide  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around  
  
You move me, from side to side  
You move me and it feels so right  
You move me up and down  
You move me around and around

I know you wanna leave me  
But I refuse to let you go  
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy  
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

Just to keep you from walking away  
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand  
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can

Come on, try it, come on, try it

How can you turn and walk away  
Leaving me here with things to say  
How can you stand and watch me fall  
Don't you feel no love at all  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break your Papa's heart  
For him to hear the things you say  
When we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus:]  
Will you hold me in your arms or let me go  
'Cause I want to show the world how much I know  
That I love you  
And I only want to be with you  
  
How do I know you'll always stay  
You're changing your mind most every day  
I'm telling you girl don't push too far no  
Just who do you think you are  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break your Mama's heart  
For her to hear the things you say  
When we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Oh I love you so  
Are you ready, for a guy like me  
Come on baby, I'm on bended knee  
Are you ready to be loved by me again  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break my loving heart  
For me to see the things you do  
When we could make a brand new start  
Yes we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus:]


[Chorus]  
Behind the smile that I portray  
I am saddened every day  
My eyes are sore with endless nights of crying  
I hope that you don't feel this way  
  
My heart fills with tears when you pass me by  
You won't look me in the eye  
Don't you think that it's a crying shame  
We must play these silly games  
The pain in my heart that shows we're apart  
Is growing stronger day by day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you think that I have done you wrong  
I won't try to change your mind  
But try to think of the love that we once had  
And maybe things won't seem so bad  
The memories of those times are vivid in my mind  
And yet they slip away as time goes on  
  
Take me back tonight  
Hold me close and tight  
Forever I will be true  
Behind the smiles that we portray  
There is nothing hidden away  
Our eyes are sore because we are crying  
I hope we'll always feel this way


Astley  
  
Do you ever feel like you are drowning  
Do you ever feel like you are going under fast  
Do you ever feel that you are wasted  
And you need a little confidence to pull you through  
Do you ever feel like you are losing  
Does it ever feel like you are fighting against the tide  
Do you ever feel like you are helpless  
And you need somebody who can show you the way  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know that I'm always with you  
You know that I'm by your side  
You know that I'm always with you  
In body and soul, body and soul  
  
Do you ever feel like you are running  
Do you ever feel like you are hiding from the truth  
Do you ever feel that you have wasted all the precious time  
That you've been given all of our life  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
You may get so sad and weary  
But you're never going under,  
Do you ever sit and wonder why I  
Always there for you cause I won't let them drag  
No I won't let them drag you down  
  
(Repeat chorus)


Paper Towers Of Vogue And Vanity Fair  
They Are Still Standing  
And The Spaces In The Bathroom Are Incredibly Bare  
And It's Better This Way  
  
And I Don't Miss The Sunrise On The Colours Of Your Hair  
And I Don't Mind The Mornings No Not Much Any More No Not  
Much Any More  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air  
  
There Will Be Dust On The Spice Rack In No Time At All  
Tell Me, Who's Around To Notice  
And I Won't Run From The Shower Whenever You Call  
And It's Better This Way  
  
And I Won't Miss The Starlight And The Clothes You Used To Wear  
And I Don't Mind The Moonlight No Not Much Anymore No Not  
Much Anymore  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air  
  
And You Know I Can Handle It, I Can Handle It, I'm Getting Out More  
And You Know I'm Over It, I'm So Over It, Until I Close The Door  
  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When Your Perfume's Everywhere  
And It Hurts To Breathe, When The Memories Are Hanging In The Air


She's taken my time.  
Convinced me she's fine.  
But when she leaves, I'm not so sure.  
It's always the same.  
She's playing her game.  
And when she goes I feel to blame.  
Why won't she say she needs me?  
I know she's not as strong as she seems.  
  
Why don't I see her cry for help?  
Why don't I feel her cry for help?  
Why don't I hear her cry for help?  
  
I wandered around  
The streets of this town  
Trying to find sense of it all.  
The rain on my face,  
It covers the trace  
All of the tears I'd had to waste.  
Why must we hide emotions?  
Why must we never break down and cry?  
  
All that I need is to cry for help.  
Somebody please hear me cry for help.  
All I can do is cry for help.  
  
No need to feel ashamed.  
Release the pain.  
Cry for help.  
  
Cry for help is all I need.  
All I need is a cry for help.  
Cry for help is all I need.  
All I need is a cry for help.  
  
Why must we hide emotions?  
Why can't we ever break down and cry?  
All that I need is to cry for help.  
I will be there when you cry for help.  
Why don't I hear her cry for help?  
  
All that I need is to cry for help.  
Somebody please hear me cry for help.  
All I can do is cry for help.  
  
All that I need is to cry for help.  
I will be there when you cry for help.  
Is it so hard to cry for help?  
  
Cry for help is all I need.  
No need to feel ashamed.  
All I need is a cry for help.  
Come on and release the pain.  
Cry for help is all I need.  
Put your trust in me.  
All I need is a cry for help.  
My love is gonna set you free.  
  
Woooooooooooooo.

I may not always show it  
But deep down don't you know that I care  
There are no words to tell you  
But if there were I'd tell you I swear  
I'm not the kind of guy  
Who shows how he feels inside  
  
Don't ask me to say it, you know that I love you  
Don't ask me to prove it, there's no one above you  
  
I watch you when you're dressing  
I love the way you play with your hair  
The simple things I notice  
I'd know if they were no longer there  
I just can't explain  
Why I'm speechless once again  
  
Remember the good times we had it all  
We shared them together  
Forget all the bad times we beat them all  
We beat them together  
  
Don't ask me to say it, you know that I love you  
Don't ask me to prove it, there's no one above you


Not so long ago my life was, oh, so easy  
I did what I want, said what I want  
I did what I want, said what I want  
Not so long ago my life was, oh, so easy  
I did what I want, said what I want  
I did what I want, and then you came  
Once in my life I found a joy like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again, again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love  
As the days go by I see that it's so easy  
To do what I want, say what I want  
Do what I want, say what I want  
As the days go by, yeah, I feel that it's so easy  
To do what I want, say what I want, do what I want  
And only once in my life I may find a joy like this  
One special moment captured by a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again, again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love  
I've got enough love, ooh yeah, I've got enough love, ooh  
And only once in your life you may feel like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of your life you may never feel like this again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love  


Oh yeah baby, oh now girl, oh now lover

Gonna love you while the world spins around  
Gonna be with you for the rest of my days  
And nothing's gonna stand in be way  
'Cause I want you baby, I need you baby  
I want to feel your body close to mine

[Chorus:]  
Every time you go away

[Chorus:]


Cardboard boxes on the floor  
They contain memories and so much more  
Black and white photographs  
Faded now but I remember how we laughed  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
I've an empty house, full of you  
  
Pour myself a glass of wine  
Let it breathe but I don't give it too much time  
Take another and set it down  
I kid myself there's nobody else around  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
I've an empty glass, full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I can't fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
  
I hear footsteps by the door  
Could it be there's nothing else that I want more  
There you stand in front of me  
I see your face my heart has wings you set me free  
  
There's nothing left for me to do  
Now my empty heart, is full of you  
  
But let me tell you baby  
I can't fight the feeling  
I never stopped believing  
You were coming back to me  
Let me tell you darling  
Never did I doubt you  
I can't live without you  
It's so good you're back with me


We've been trying for a long time  
To say what we want to say  
But feelings don't come easy  
To express in a simple way  
  
But we all have feelings  
We all need loving  
And who would be the fool to say, that if you  
  
Hold me in your arms  
I won't feel better  
If you hold me in your arms  
We can brave this storm together  
  
We both know there's a problem  
A problem that we've got to face  
So put your trust in me, lover  
No-one's ever gonna take your place  
  
'Cause we all have a problem  
We all have fears  
But there's always got to be a way  
Yes we all have feelings  
We all need loving  
And you would be a fool to say, that if you  
  
Hold me in your arms  
I won't feel better  
If you hold me in your arms  
We can brave this storm together  
  
You only have to hold me  
Touch me to make me feel so good  
You only have to hold me  
Feel me  
To make me feel the way you know I should  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
When you gonna hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms


I walk the wire every night  
I can't decide between wrong and right  
I've lost control over the things I do  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who never took a chance  
Becomes a victim of circumstance  
I've lost my way now I'm so confused  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams are far behind me  
They don't matter any more  
I don't care about the things I could lose  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who always played it safe  
Becomes another who's lost his way  
I can't believe it though I know it's true  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams begin to blind me  
And I was so confused  
And I don't care about the things I could lose  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
I'm not gonna fight it I'm gonna choose  
To hopelessly fall oh yeah  
You know I'll hopelessly fall in love with you


I don't want to be your lover  
  
Last night I heard you creeping  
I was almost sleeping  
When I heard you come home  
You knew I loved you madly  
And I would gladly  
Do anything for you  
  
You climbed the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed  
  
Tell me how you could do it  
Why put me through it  
When you said you'd be true  
You said that it was nothing  
But it was something  
And sometimes that's enough  
  
So climb the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed  
  
You climbed the stairs to heaven  
But you may never climb those steps again  
You thought you'd be forgiven  
But I was driven to make you understand  
  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your head  
I don't want to be your lover  
When there's another lover in your bed


I don't wanna lose her  
I don't wanna lose her  
  
They told me that she had found somebody new  
But I don't believe it  
They said I would soon find out she was untrue  
But I just can't see it  
  
Maybe I am wrong to doubt it  
And now that I think about it  
If ever I lost her love  
I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I couldn't imagine life without her love  
I just couldn't take it  
If you wanted to know how well I would get on  
I don't think I'd make it  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I'm gonna make a new start  
And bring her back to my heart  
'Cause what I found out about her  
I just cannot live without her  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it


I Wanna Believe You When You Say, Love Is Here Tonight  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, That Love Is Here  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, Good Times Are Near Tonight  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, Good Times Are Near  
And I Do, I Do, And It's You, It's You  
And I Feel So Good I Feel Like I Could Fly  
Will I Wait I'll Wait, Will I Stay, I'll Stay  
'cause It's Only Here With You That I Get High  
I Wanna Believe You, I Wanna Believe You, I Wanna Believe You  
Believe In You  
I Wanna Believe You, I Wanna Believe You, I Wanna Believe You  
Believe In You  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, Love Will Find A Way  
I Wanna Believe You That Love Will Find A Way  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, The Sun Will Shine Today  
I Wanna Believe You When You Say, The Sun Will Shine  
And It's You, Yeah You, What You Do, You Do  
And I Wanna Tell The World Just How I Feel  
This Is Love, Yeah Love, Good Love, Good Love  
And I Wanna Tell The World That This Is Real  
  


Day and night, I wonder how you're feeling  
I wonder if you'll ever change your mind  
I don't know just what it is you're dealing  
But I know you've got me in a bind  
  
[Bridge:]  
Day and night, I wonder how you do it  
Put me in this awful state of mind  
How on earth can you be so unfeeling?  
How on earth can you be so unkind?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well, I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
  
You never want to sit and talk it over  
You always want to run right out the door  
Come and sit right down here on the sofa  
Tell me, baby, right now what's the score?  
  
Don't you tell me there ain't nothing doing  
There ain't nothing else that's true to say  
I just wanna hear my baby cooing  
I don't wanna hear our love is dead  
  
I will be fine with you if you be good to me  
  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
I'll be fine with you in the morning  
If you'll be good to me tonight  
  
If you'll be good to me, I'll be fine with you  
If you'll be good to me, then we just can't lose  
If you'll be good to me, I'll be happy for all of my days  
  
Day and night, I wonder how you're feeling  
I wonder if you'll ever change your mind  
I don't know just what it is you're dealing  
But I know you've got me in a bind  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]


Me, I'm just a simple guy  
And no matter how hard I try  
I may never show you how I feel  
  
You may be the woman I love  
I sometimes think that you've been sent from above  
I am trying to be a man  
Heaven knows, I do the best that I can  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
Me, I'll be a shoulder to cry on  
I'll be someone you can rely on  
And maybe you may see just how I feel  
  
We may be so far apart  
But you still know I've got a hungry heart  
We must be patient, it won't last forever  
It won't be long until we're together  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be strong, I'll show you how love can be  
I'll never let you down  
Come what my way  
  
We must be patient, it won't last forever  
It won't be long until we're together  
  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be there whenever you need me  
I'll never let you down  
I'll be strong, I'll show you how love can be


There's nothing I can say  
There's nothing I can do  
To show you the love  
That I got for you  
  
There's nothing in this world  
That could ever take your place  
When I look into your eyes  
I see a sweet face  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I love you (I'll never set, set you free)  
And I need you (I'll never set, set you free)  
Yes, I want you (I'll never set, set you free)  
'Cause I love you (I'll never set, set you free)  
  
Will you open up your heart  
So love could make a start?  
I know that if you do  
Dreams will come true  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
There's nothing you can do  
To stop my love for you  
  
[Chorus]


I know that love could realign the phases of the moon  
Yet it comes and goes like a wave of a stranger  
And as we stumble for the truth  
We're caught in a web of lies  
Is nothin' worth a damn without the danger  
We're lost in a world of illusive dreams  
Where every story has a desperate ring  
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love  
And though sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love  
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best  
We could see the light unfold right before our eyes  
Blinded by the tears, we get lost in the shadows  
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing  
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain  
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love  
And though sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love  
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best  
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing  
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain  
We got a right to happiness, in the name of love  
And may be sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love  
And without pause or regret  
Searching only for the best  
Try name of love,  
Try in the name of love  


There are times when a woman makes you laugh and cry  
Nobody knows when she is telling lies  
I just want to hear the truth from you  
So don't play those games you always do  
You don't have to hide the way you feel  
Tell me if your love for me is real  
  
[Chorus]  
Is this really love  
Is this the real thing  
Is this really love  
Can it be the right thing  
  
I was born in a prison there was no way out  
If you want to be heard you got to scream and shout  
You don't know the kind of mess I'm in  
Nobody else is going to save my skin but  
You have got the key to set me free  
If you want my love then rescue me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You don't have to hide the way you feel  
Tell me if your love for me is real  
  
[Chorus: x2]


My heart starts breaking  
When I think of making up  
Plans to let you go  
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow  
I'm gonna let you know  
But when I think about leaving  
I think about losing  
The only love I ever knew  
Every time I think of you  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know, you know, you know  
  
It would take a strong, strong man  
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)  
To ever let you go  
  
My heart's been hurting  
When I see you flirting  
Every night out on the floor  
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow  
You'l grow to love me more  
But whenever we're together  
I could leave you never  
Even though you treat me cruel  
Every time I look at you  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know, you know, you know  
  
It would take a strong, strong man  
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)  
To ever let you go  
  
I tried to resist you  
When you're gone, all I ever do is miss you  
Anyone in love would know  
Anyone with half a heart  
Could never let you go  
  
But when I think about leaving  
I think about losing  
The only girl I ever loved  
Can't you tell me why do you hurt me  
I guess some people never see  
Especially a fool like me  
  
My heart starts aching  
My hands keep shaking  
And you know, you know, you know  
  
It would take a strong, strong man  
To ever let you go  
To ever let you go (to ever let you go)  
I'll never let you go


Look At Me  
Hanging On A Word, Every Little Word  
Look At You  
Staring Out The Window, For A Different Point Of View  
What Should We Do  
  
Nothings Changed  
Everything's The Same, Same Old Same  
Lie In Bed  
Staring At The Ceiling, Wish I Was Somewhere Else Instead  
Enough Said  
  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
  
I Have Found  
I Can't Stand The Silence, Can't You Make A Sound  
What Is Wrong  
I See Your Body Language, Telling Me You Think It's Over  
Before It's Over  
  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Can't Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
I'll Do Anything At All  
Let's Go Out Tonight  
  
You Say We've Got To Get Away  
We've Outgrown This Town It's So Mundane  
But If You're Asking Me  
The Chance Is There But We're Never Gonna Leave  
Never Gonna Leave


Many Roads I've Travelled  
And Faces I've Seen  
Each Tells A Story  
Of What Might Have Been  
A Missed Golden Moment  
But Life Still Remains  
A Search For The Innocence  
Somehow We Lost On The Way  
  
And We All Need A Miracle, That I Truly Believe  
Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle Is You  
  
Now The Silence That Follows  
The Last Curtain Call  
I Don't Know Anyone  
Who Has Come Through It All  
You Gave Me Direction  
A Part In Your Cast  
No Longer Make Believe  
Now That I Know It Will Last  
  
'cause We All Need A Miracle, That I Truly Believe  
Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle  
  
And I Believe My Miracle  
I Believe My Miracle  
Yes I Believe My Miracle Is You


She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
Life is hard in a Midlands town  
For a girl with her head in the clouds  
Everybody puts her down  
She's just one of the crowd  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
Now it's time for her to find  
The way it's always been  
Love is just a word to her  
Another broken dream  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
She finds it aint easy  
To stand on her own two feet  
It aint easy  
She knows this time she wont be beat  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl  
  
She's a modern girl  
Out to rule the world  
And nothing can stop her now  
She knows what she wants  
And she's out to get it  
She's a modern girl

You know I've been so lonely, every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down, any night  
Is that the way you're made girl  
  
I keep telling myself it's all right  
Even though I cry  
There's no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: ]  
My arms keep missing you  
Who's been kissing you  
Since you went away  
My arms keep missing you  
I keep wishing you'd  
Come back today  
  
You said you wouldn't hurt me anyway  
And I believe in you  
We said we trust each other every day  
We'd never be untrue  
  
But I keep thinking you're telling lies  
Even though I try  
There's no question why  
How can I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
You know I've been so lonely, every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down, any night  
Is that the way you're made girl  
  
I keep telling myself it's all right  
Even though I cry  
There's no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2x]


We're no strangers to love  
You know the rules and so do I  
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of  
You wouldn't get this from any other guy  
  
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling  
Gotta make you understand  
  
[Chorus:]  
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  
  
We've known each other for so long  
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it  
Inside we both know what's been going on  
We know the game and we're gonna play it  
  
And if you ask me how I'm feeling  
Don't tell me you're too blind to see  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  
  
(Ooh give you up)  
(Ooh give you up)  
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)  
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)  
  
We've known each other for so long  
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it  
Inside we both know what's been going on  
We know the game and we're gonna play it  
  
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling  
Gotta make you understand  
  
[Chorus x3]  
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down  
Never gonna run around and desert you  
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye  
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you


Your love is warm as a ray of sun  
Touching me when the morning comes  
So lucky am I to have you by my side  
Forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Never knew love could feel this way  
Never knew love could do this to me  
Never knew love could feel this way  
Never knew love could do this to me  
  
Thought I had it all in the palm of my hand  
Darkness had fallen on me and I didn't quite understand  
Then came you you brightened up my days yeah  
Forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I know  
Never knew love never knew love  
Could feel this way  
Could do this to me  
Could feel this way  
Could do this to me  
I never knew your love  
Could do this to me  
Could feel this way  
  
[Chorus]


I've been waiting  
For a love to call my own  
I've been hoping  
You would say you're coming home  
I will put my arms around you  
Baby, I'm so glad I found you  
There ain't nothing I can do  
Now that I'm in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
I've been thinking  
'Bout the way you looked last night  
I remember how we held each other tight  
As we lay beside the fire  
Felt the heat of pure desire  
There ain't nothing I can do  
Now that I'm in love with you  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
I'm so glad that love has come around  
I'm so thankful for the love I've found  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true  
  
No more looking for love  
Now that I'm in love with you  
No, there's no more looking for love  
Now I've found a love that's true


Here we are  
Riding high  
We've some so far  
We can touch the sky  
  
So why can't we live together  
Can't we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
[Chorus]  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix yeah  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We just can't do it  
  
Talk to me  
Scream and shout  
Trust in me  
We can work it out  
  
We all know the world keeps turning  
One day at a time  
Easier lessons for leaving  
We just couldn't find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So why can't we live together  
Can't we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
Oh yeah  
Won't you trust in me  
I know we can make it yeah  
  
I close my eyes and look inside  
For a picture of how it should be  
And I wonder if you could see what I see  
  
Would you ever choose to live the way you do  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix b'dum yeah  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We just can't do it  
  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix b'dum yeah  
I know we got the pieces  
But they just don't fit  
  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix  
I know we got the pieces  
We just can't do it


She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
Hoo!  
She wants to dance with me  
Mmm, mmm, mmm  
  
There's a girl I've been waiting to see  
And I really get the feeling that she likes me  
'Cause she said so, but not in so many words  
I've got to tell you what I heard  
  
She don't want no wild romance  
When she's with me she only wants to dance  
  
[Chorus:]  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
Now I know I've been out of touch  
But I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much  
'Cause I love her and i think she loves me  
And that's the way it's got to be  
  
When we're together we never fight  
We've got better things to do tonight  
  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I hold her so tight next to me  
She wants to dance with me  
'Cause I let her be what she wants to be  
  
She wants to dance  
She wants to dance  
  
[Chorus To Fade]


I toss and turn, I'm turning around but I cannot sleep  
I'm hypnotized, I'm paralyzed by a different beat  
I hear your voice getting louder now, yet so out of reach  
But I'm mistaken, it's only the echo of you  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
And the night goes on and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on  
  
A crowded bar, the mating game so I'm out of place  
It's so bizarre, she coming onto me, but I see your face  
The DJ plays familiar songs and it takes me back  
But I'm mistaken, it's only the echo of you  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
And I need healing it's been so long  
And the night goes on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
  
I hear your voice, I hear your voice calling  
I hear your voice? on and on and on and on  
  
I toss and turn I'm turning around but I just can't sleep  
I'm hypnotized I'm paralyzed  
  
And I'm not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I need healing it's been so long  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I m not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I need healing it's been so long  
(I hear your voice calling)  
And I m not sleeping now that you're gone  
(I hear your voice calling)  
I can't help feeling I did you wrong  
(I hear your voice calling)


I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
People ask me how's your love affair  
I an only tell them lies  
When they ask me where you are tonight  
I can only fantasize  
  
You may find somebody new  
You'll say you love him, that's not true  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
Everybody thinks we're so in love  
But things aren't always what they seem  
Even my best friend says we're so good  
Just how wrong can a person be  
  
You may find somebody new  
You'll say you love him, that's not true  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day


I left my baby  
I bought a ticket for the train  
I waited all day long  
But the train never came  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
The train never came  
  
The reason I was leaving  
Was all because of sin  
I didn't want to do it  
But I was sucked in  
  
And I was so sad  
I was so bad  
I didn't go home  
  
I was out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
Gambling all my money  
Got into a fight  
  
And I cried for my baby  
But my baby never came  
Sirens were a wailing  
And I stepped off of the train  
  
I picked up my bags  
And started down the road  
The night was drawing in now  
And I was getting cold  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
She was still home  
  
I'll never go out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
I'm saving all my money  
Never getting in a fight  
  
And I'll stay with my baby  
Never leaving her alone  
I'm keeping outta trouble  
So I'll be staying at home  
  
I'll be so glad  
We're both still home  
  
We're both still home  
  
We're both still home  
  
Staying at home  
Staying at home  
  
We're both still home


Are we lovers  
Or only just friends?  
Come tomorrow.  
Will I be lonely again?

Is all I need to know.

When you look at me  
If you need me?  
In all honesty.  
Because I'm certain  
As sure as can be:  
I'd make you happy  
Eternally.  
  
'Cause I think about you (think about you)  
When you're far away.  
And I dream about you (dream about you)

If you knew what I'm feeling  
You would not say no.  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
For your love, for your love,  
Is all I need to know.


When we were out dancing the other night  
You almost got me into another fight  
You always want to prove you've got the touch, baby  
To make all the other guys want you so much  
  
But if you ever do that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby that's  
  
[Chorus]  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
  
If you really love me like you say  
Wouldn't keep on hurting me this way  
You always turn away when I call your name  
And baby things just stay the same  
  
So if you ever do that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby that's  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Here we go  
You've got to believe it's over  
You've got to believe it's true  
You've got to believe it's over  
And we're through  
  
You've got to believe it's over  
You've got to believe it's true  
You've got to believe it's over  
And we're through  
  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
  
All that you have ever done for me  
Is show just how rotten life can be  
But this has taught me one thing that's for sure yeah  
I'll never let that girl back through my door  
  
And if she ever does that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby that's  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'd like to thank you all for coming this evening  
All you people all you people out there  
You're all beautiful  
I wanna take each and every one of you home with me tonight


Children cry on the street  
They don't have enough to eat  
Mothers wait for days to end  
A hopeless situation they can't mend  
  
Is it good for you?  
Is it good for me?  
I don't know how the world can sleep  
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
[Chorus]  
They'd better be the ones you love  
The children ought to get some love  
If no-one else should get enough  
They'd better be the ones you love  
  
Daddy waits there in line  
A little work he hopes to find  
Something wrong with times like these  
It's enough to bring a man down to his knees  
  
Is it good for you?  
Is it good for me?  
I don't know how the world can sleep  
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Thinking of the children  
You better be think about the children  
Better be, you better be  
Better be the ones you love  
Better be, you better be  
Better be the ones you love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Is it good for you?  
Is it good for me?  
I don't know how the world can sleep  
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
They'd better be the ones you love  
The children ought to get some love  
If no-one else should get enough  
They'd better be the ones you love


When I was much younger  
It used to happen every night  
I had a dream about a city dressed in lights  
And there were friends of mine  
I saw them time after time  
But I never knew their names  
And darling I swear  
I saw you there  
I know it sounds insane  
  
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy  
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me  
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here  
Must be something went right  
I just know when you're near  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what I've been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door  
  
How could I have doubted  
I guess I must have lost my place  
You turned on the light  
And I saw my life  
Reflected in your face  
  
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy oh yeah  
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me  
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here  
Must be something went right  
I just know when you're near  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what I've been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door  
  
And I always knew that there was something more  
  
Come closer to me now  
You fill me up I'm overflowing  
Come closer to me now  
Come hold me tight and don't let go  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what I've been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door


When I fall in love it will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before it's begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart it will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
And the moment I can feel  
That you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
  
And the moment I can feel  
That you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you
