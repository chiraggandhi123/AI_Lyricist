[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?


[Verse 1]  
When did it go wrong, I will never know  
I have loved you all my life  
How did it slow down, I go round and round  
Thinking about it all the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
This love, it ain't over yet  
There's too much that I haven't said  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?  
What was I thinking, I gave you everything  
But you still went for the kill  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark  
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat  
Do you even know that I can't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Hope you know, I won't let go


Found myself today singing out your name,  
You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you


Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life


[Verse 1]  
Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years  
You'd like to meet, to go over  
Everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


[Verse 1]  
I want every single piece of you  
I want your heaven and your oceans too  
Treat me soft but touch me cruel  
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
Bring the floor up to my knees  
Let me fall into your gravity  
Then kiss me back to life to see  
Your body standing over me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Verse 2]  
I love the way your body moves  
Towards me from across the room  
Brushing past my every groove  
No one has me like you do  
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul  
But be delicate with my ego  
I wanna step into your great unknown  
With you and me setting the tone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Bridge]  
We play so dirty in the dark  
Cause we are living worlds apart  
It only makes it harder, baby  
It only makes it harder, baby  
Harder baby, harder baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Outro]  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you


Right under my feet there's air made of bricks  
Pulls me down turns me weak for you  
I find myself repeating like a broken tune  
And I'm forever excusing your intentions  
That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
You've burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Why do you steal my hand  
Whenever I'm standing my own ground  
You build me up, then leave me dead  
  
I hear your words you made up  
I say your name like there should be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love  
I'm the only one in love


Picture perfect memories,  
Scattered all around the floor.  
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk,  
And I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
I just need you now.  
Oh baby I need you now.


Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  


I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


[Verse 1]  
Looking for something I can be  
The fact I don't think it would mean  
The first half and I love the newspaper  
And the only way you want a boycott of the best way  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Bridge]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Instead it will take the first half and I have  
Under pressure from the same as I am  
Whoever you can get the same as a result of the bestselling  
Great to have to do that in my room for a long day ahead with its own section  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I just want to see my friends to be able too many things that make  
I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Bridge]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
  
[Refrain]  
Whoever you can get the same as a result of the bestselling  
Great to have to do that in my room for a long day ahead with its own section  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this

I love it so hard I don't think that I get told the court  
  
[Outro]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel...


[Verse 1]  
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish I'd said  
At the dawning of the day  
I can't wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[Hook]  
I can't drown in your tears  
I won't face your fears  
I need to fight my own  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know I'll survive  
You'll never see me again


Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?  
It's been there for days on end and  
It's been waiting for you to open up  
Yours too baby, come on now  
I'm trying to tell you just how  
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally  
Say that it's always been me  
  
[Chorus]  
That's made you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  
But you'd save the best for last  
Like I'm the one for you  
  
You should know that you're just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest  
It turns out it ain't enough  
You're still not mentioning love  
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?  
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere  
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her  
And I think that I know things may never change  
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say  
  
I make you feel the way you've never felt before  
And I'm all you need and that you never want more  
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue  
But you'd save the best for last  
Like I'm the one for you  
  
You should know that you're just a temporary fix  
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me  
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free  
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me  
  
But, despite the truth that I know  
I find it hard to let go and give up on you  
Seems I love the things you do  
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am  
To persist with this heartbreak and running around  
And I will do until I'm finding myself you  
  
And make you feel a way you've never felt before  
And be all you need so that you never want more  
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue  
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you


The fish swam  
Out of the ocean  
And grew legs  
And they started walking  
And the apes climbed down  
From the trees  
And grew tall  
And they started talking  
  
And the stars  
Fell out of the sky  
And my tears  
Rolled into the ocean  
Now I'm looking  
For a reason why  
You even set my world  
Into motion  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
  
I looked up  
Into the grey sky  
And see a thousand eyes  
Staring back  
And all around  
These golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel a way of something  
Beyond them  
I don't see  
What I can feel  
If vision  
Is the only validation  
Then most of my life  
Isn't real  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold  
Black and gold


I've made up my mind,  
Don't need to think it over,  
If I'm wrong I am right,  
Don't need to look no further,  
This ain't lust,  
I know this is love but,  
  
If I tell the world,  
I'll never say enough,  
Cause it was not said to you,  
And that's exactly what I need to do,  
If I'm in love with you,  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
I'd build myself up,  
And fly around in circles,  
Waiting as my heart drops,  
And my back begins to tingle  
Finally could this be it or  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere yeah  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if, it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?  
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere


You say it's all in my head  
And the things I think just don't make sense  
So where you been then? Don't go all coy  
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault  
See I can see that look in your eyes  
The one that shoots me each and every time  
  
You grace me with your cold shoulder  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
You shower me with words made of knives  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
  
These days when I see you  
You make it look like I'm see-through  
Do tell me why you waste our time  
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied  
You know I know just how you feel  
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too  
  
When you grace me with your cold shoulder  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
You shower me with words made of knives  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
  
Time and time again, I play the role of fool  
(Just for you)  
Even in the daylight when you think that  
(I don't see you)  
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find  
Though I do know how you play  
  
You grace me with your cold shoulder  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
You shower me with words made of knives  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
  
You grace me with your cold shoulder  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her  
You shower me with words made of knives  
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her


When will I see you again?  
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said  
No final kiss to seal anything  
I had no idea of the state we were in  
  
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
When was the last time you thought of me?  
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?  
I often think about where I went wrong  
The more I do, the less I know  
  
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head  
But don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before,  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe  
I kept my distance so you would be free,  
In hope that you find the missing piece  
To bring you back to me  
  
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
When will I see you again?


I'm insane in the brain  
You're not ready to get caught  
Feel the pain rushing through my vain  
Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious  
Other words are spring to my head  
... Emolicious, for the shoot posses no spine  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
You're out of control with nobody around to help  
Help, help oh oh.  
  
Chorus:  
This time you're on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home  
But if she's not there and you're on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4.  
  
Hustle mind, testify, you remain oblivious  
Wanna try to testify in the hope of happiness  
Be the best, have success,  
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood  
  
Feel blessed not impressed  
By the glamour if you think you could.  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
You're out of control with nobody around to help  
Help, help oh oh.  
  
Chorus:  
This time you're on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home  
But if she's not there and you're on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4.  
  
Fiasco, fiasco  
  
[Chorus:]  
1 2 3 4  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco,  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco,  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco.


So little to say but so much time,  
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind.  
Please wear the face, the one where you smile,  
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry.  
  
Forgive me first love, but I'm tired.  
I need to get away to feel again.  
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind.  
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself  
Simply, it's tiring.  
  
This love has dried up and stayed behind,  
And if I stay I'll be alive,  
Then choke on words I'd always hide.  
Excuse me first love, but we're through.  
I need to taste the kiss from someone new.  
  
Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.  
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.  
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love,  
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love


What does it to keep us together?  
We love so strong it's like dying  
Then we fight so hard we end up crying.  
Who are you that I can't let you go?  
  
Chorus-Why don't we let peace live between us and give ourselves a chance  
To  
Live in the largeness of love.  
  
You fill me with ecstasy until  
You leave me craving your will.  
When will you end this up and down  
I've had enough of looking for you upptown.  
  
Chorus  
  
I need you as a babe needs a mother's caress,  
Your heart to me is like an act of theft,  
Without your heart I am left bereft,  
Give me all you have now I need you boy.  
Chorus For all eternity you will be mine, I'll go to battle for what  
Belongs  
To me. What troubles have I caused you to deserve this. There is no one who  
  
Will love you like me. Chorus.  
Cho


Some say, I'll be better without you,  
They don't know you like I do,  
Or at least as far as I thought I knew  
I can't bear this time,  
It drags, as I lose my mind  
Reminded by things I find  
I know some clothes you left behind.  
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done  
I won't rise until this battle's won  
My dignity is become undone  
  
But I won't go  
I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,  
If this is ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,  
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined  
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying  
I heard his voice today  
I didn't know a single word he said  
Not one resemblance to the man I met  
Just a vacant broken boy instead  
  
But I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
There will be times, we'll try and give it up  
Bursting at the seams, no doubt  
We almost fall apart and burn to pieces  
So watch them turn to dust  
But nothing will never taint us  
  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
Will he, will he still remember me?  
Will he still love me even when he's free  
Or will he go back to the place where  
He will choose the poison over me?  
When we spoke yesterday  
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait  
I'll be home soon, I won't be late  
  
He won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
He's willing to take the risk  
So I won't go, He can't do it on his own,  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
'Cause he won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
We're willing to take the risk  
I won't go! I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk


This is how the story went  
I met someone by accident  
It blew me away  
It blew me away  
  
It was in the darkest of my days  
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  
And buried them away, you buried them away  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
Drop you off at the train station  
Put a kiss on top of your head  
Watch you wave  
Watched you wave  
  
Then I went on home to your skyscrapers  
Neon lights and waiting papers  
That you call home  
I call it home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
I woke up feeling heavy hearted  
I'm going back to where I started  
The morning rain, the morning rain  
Although I wish that you were here  
That same old road that brought me here  
Is calling me home, It's calling me home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
And I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away


I've been walking in the same way as I did  
Missing out the cracks in the pavement  
And turning my heel and strutting my feet  
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?  
Is there anyone I could call?"  
"No and thank you, please Madam.  
I ain't lost, just wandering"  
  
Round my hometown  
Memories are fresh  
Round my hometown  
Ooh the people I've met  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of this world  
Are the wonders of now  
  
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque  
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades  
I like it in the city when two worlds collide  
You get the people and the government  
Everybody taking different sides  
  
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit  
Shows that we are united  
Shows that we ain't gonna take it  
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit  
Shows that we are united  
  
Round my hometown  
Memories are fresh  
Round my hometown  
Ooh the people I've met yea  
  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Are the wonders of this world  
Are the wonders of my world  
Of my world, yeah  
Of my world  
Of my world, yeah


You've been on my mind  
I grow fonder every day  
Lose myself in time  
Just thinking of your face  
But, God only knows  
Why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go  
You're the only one that I want  
  
I don't know why I'm scared  
I've been here before  
Every feeling  
Every word  
I've imagined it all  
You never know if you never try  
To forgive your past  
And simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be, oh  
Your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
If I've been on your mind  
You hang on every word I say  
Lose yourself in time  
At the mention of my name  
Will I ever know  
How it feels to hold you close  
And have you tell me  
Which ever road I choose you go  
  
I don't know why I'm scared  
I've been here before  
Every feeling  
Every word  
I've imagined it all  
You never know if you never try  
To forgive your past  
And simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be, your  
Your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
I know it ain't easy  
Giving up your heart  
I know it ain't easy  
Giving up your heart  
Nobody's perfect  
Just because trust me I've earned it  
  
I dare you to let me be, oh  
Your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me a chance  
To prove I am the one who has  
Walked that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
Come on and give me the chance  
To prove I am the one who can  
Walk that mile  
Until the end starts


I thought I told you, he'd be home soon  
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.  
I fall short each time,  
Every time he ain't here  
You and your charm creep closer  
Closer and near  
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.  
Like a bomb before explosion,  
Ticking by your call,  
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,  
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.  
  
But I found a boy who I love more,  
Than I ever did you before,  
So stand beside the river I cried,  
And lay yourself down.  
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.  
  
So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees  
At the first sight of you crawling back to me  
To whisper "will you leave your man? "  
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.  
I won't stand by you.  
  
Cause I found a boy who I love more,  
Than I ever did you before,  
So stand beside the river I cried  
And lay yourself down.  
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!  
  
I ain't yours for no taking,  
You must be mistaken  
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong  
And ignore the right  
  
When I found a boy who loves me more,  
Than you ever did me before.  
So stand beside the river you cried  
And lay yourself down!  
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!


Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian'  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda run through the blindin' rain  
Without one dollar to my name  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love  
  
Never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in  
If it hadn't been for love  
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind  
If it hadn't been for love  
Nobody knows it better than me  
I wouldn't be wishing I was free  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love  
  
Four cold walls against my will  
At least I know she's lying still  
Four cold walls without paroll  
Lord have mercy on my soul  
  
Never woulda gone to that side of town  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda took a mind to track her down  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda loaded up a forty four  
Put myself behind a jail house door  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love  
  
Four cold walls against my will  
At least I know she's lying still  
Four cold walls without parole  
Lord have mercy on my soul  
  
Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian'  
If it hadn't been for love  
Never woulda loaded up a forty four  
Put myself behind a jail house door  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love  
If it hadn't been  
If it hadn't been for love


Hold me closer, one more time,  
Say that you love me in your last goodbye,  
Please forgive me, for my sins,  
Yes, I swam dirty waters,  
But you pushed me in,  
I've seen your face, under every sky,  
Over every border and on every line,  
You know my heart, more than I do,  
We were the greatest, me and you,  
  
But we had time against us,  
And miles between us,  
The heavens cried,  
I know I left you speechless,  
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,  
And I see my future in you,  
  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll do everything different,  
I'll be better to you,  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll be somebody different,  
I'll be better to you,  
  
Let me stay here for just one more night,  
Build your world around me,  
And pull me to the light,  
So I can tell you that I was wrong,  
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,  
  
But we had time against us,  
And miles between us,  
The heavens cried,  
I know I left you speechless,  
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,  
And I see my future in you,  
  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll do everything different,  
I'll be better to you,  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll be somebody different,  
I'll be better to you,  
  
Time against us,  
Miles between us,  
Heavens cried,  
I know I left you speechless,  
Time against us,  
Miles between us,  
Heavens cried,  
I know I left you speechless,  
I know I left you speechless  
  
I'll be waiting  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll do everything different,  
I'll be better to you,  
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,  
I'll put my hands up,  
I'll be somebody different,  
I'll be better for you,


Last night she said  
Oh, baby

Oh, and turned me off  
When I feel left out  
So I  
I turned around  
Oh, baby

Out that door  
  
Well, I've been in town  
For just about fifteen  
Ehole minutes now  
Oh, baby, I feel so down  
And I don't know why  
I keep walking for miles  
  
But the people  
They don't understand  
No, girlfriends  
They can't understand  
Your grandsons  
They won't understand  
On top of this  
I ain't ever  
Gonna understand  
  
Last night she said  
Oh, baby  
Don't feel so down  
Oh, and turned me off  
When I feel left out  
So I, I turned around  
Oh, baby  
I'm gonna be alright  
It was a great big lie  
Cuz I left that night  
Yeah  
  
Oh, people  
They don't understand  
No, girlfriends  
They don't understand  
In spaceships  
They won't understand  
And me  
I ain't ever  
Gonna understand  
  
Last night she said  
Oh, baby  
I feel so down  
She had turned me off  
When I feel left out  
So I  
I turned around  
Oh, little girl  
I don't care no more  
I know this for sure  
I'm walking  
Out that door, yeah


[Verse 1]  
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to  
Every part of me, all my words to hold  
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart  
No I'm not gonna do it standing up  
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to  
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies  
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart  
No I'm not gonna do it standing up  
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)  
  
[Bridge]  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
Lay down with me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me  
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down ('til the morning)  
Lay me down (through the night)  
Lay me down (I can fall in)  
Lay me down (Won't you)  
Lay me down (I can baby)  
Lay me down (Someone believe me)


[Verse 1]  
Take your eyes off me so I can leave  
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me  
This is never ending, we have been here before  
But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore  
Please stay where you are  
Don't come any closer  
Don't try to change my mind  
I'm being cruel to be kind  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't love you in the dark  
It feels like we're oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe we're already defeated  
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah every things changing  
  
[Verse 2]  
You have given me something that I can't live without  
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt  
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine  
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight  
Please don't fall apart  
I can't face your breaking heart  
I'm trying to be brave  
Stop asking me to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't love you in the dark  
It feels like we're oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe we're already defeated  
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing  
  
[Bridge]  
We're not the only ones  
I don't regret a thing  
Every word I've said  
You know I'll always mean  
It is the world to me  
That you are in my life  
But I want to live  
And not just survive  
  
[Instrumental Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
That's why I can't love you in the dark  
It feels like we're oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe we're already defeated  
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me  
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me


Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am home again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am whole again  
  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am young again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am fun again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am free again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am clean again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
'Cause I love you


When the rain  
Is blowing in your face  
And the whole world  
Is on your case  
I could offer you  
A warm embrace  
To make you feel my love  
  
When the evening shadows  
And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you  
Haven't made  
Your mind up yet  
But I would never  
Do you wrong  
I've known it  
From the moment  
That we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
I'd go hungry  
I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling  
Down the avenue  
No, there's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rolling sea  
And on the highway of regret  
Though winds of change  
Are throwing wild and free  
You ain't seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldn't do  
Go to the ends  
Of the Earth for you  
To make you feel my love


Go ahead  
Go ahead  
And smash it on the floor  
Take whatever's left  
And take it with you out the door  
  
See if I cry  
See if I shed a single sorry tear  
I can't say  
That it's been that great  
No  
In fact it's been a wasted year  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And there's many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Let it out  
Lett it all out  
Say what's on your mind  
You can kick and scream  
And shout and say things  
That are so unkind  
  
Yeah  
See if I care  
And see if I stand firm  
Or if I fall  
'Cause in the back of my mind  
And on the tip of my tongue  
Is the answer to it all  
  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And there's many shades of black  
There's many shades of black  
Yeah  
There's many shades of black  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Yeah  
Everybody sees and everyone agrees  
That you and I are wrong  
And it's been that way too long  
Baby take it as it comes  
And be thankful when it's done  
There's so many ways to act  
And you cannot take it back  
(Many shades of black)  
No  
You cannot take it back  
  
'Cause there's many shades of black  
(Many shades of black)  
You have many shades of black  
You have many  
(Many shades of black)  
You have many  
You have many shades of black  
  
'Cause there's many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
(Many shades of black)  
There's so many shades of black  
There's so many shades of black  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh


I only wanted to have fun  
Learning to fly learning to run  
I let my heart decide the way  
When I was young  
  
Deep down I must have always known  
That this would be inevitable  
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay  
And bare my soul  
  
I know I'm not the only one  
Who regrets the things they've done  
Sometimes I just feel it's only me  
Who can't stand in reflection that they see  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor  
I feel like my life is flashing by  
And all I can do is watch and cry  
  
I miss the air  
I miss my friends  
I miss my mother  
I miss it when  
  
Life was a party to be thrown  
But that was a million years ago  
  
When I walk around all of the streets  
Where I grew up and found my feet  
They can't look me in the eye  
It's like they scared of me  
  
I tried to think of things to say  
Like a joke or a memory  
But they don't recognize me now  
In the light of day.  
  
I know I'm not the only one  
Who regrets the things they've done  
Sometimes I just feel it's only me  
Who never became who they thought they'd be  
I wish I could live a little more  
Look up to the sky not just the floor  
I feel like my life is flashing by  
And all I can do is watch and cry  
  
I miss the air  
I miss my friends  
I miss my mother  
I miss it when,  
  
Life was a party to be thrown  
But that was a million years ago  
  
A Million Years Ago...


You said I'm stubborn and I never give in  
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening  
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that  
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact  
I say we've only known each other a year  
You say I've known you longer my dear  
You like to be so close, I like to be alone  
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor  
Walking with each other,  
Think we'll never match at all, but we do  
But we do, but we do, but we do  
  
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more  
I've never known this, never before  
You're the first to make up whenever we argue  
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you  
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative  
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining  
You think we would and we do,  
But we do, but we do, but we do  
  
Favoritism ain't my thing but,  
In this situation I'll be glad  
  
Favoritism ain't my thing but,  
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception  
  
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in  
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening  
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that  
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact  
I say we've only known each other one year  
You say I've known you longer my dear  
You like to be so close, I like to be alone  
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor  
Walking with each other,  
Think we'll never match at all, but we do


I know sometimes you're scared of the light  
But how will you ever know if you never try  
There's something new inside my heart  
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart  
I see your face under every sky  
I find the less I look, more I find  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
  
You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark  
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms  
You said my name in the dead of glory  
You hold me alright  
When I'm short of falling  
  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
  
There will be times  
When we'll try to give it up  
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to
pieces  
And we'll watch them turn to dust  
But without each other, nothing is easy enough  
  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah  
You're the only one  
Never gonna leave you  
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no


Don't ask me  
What you know is true  
Don't have to tell you  
I love your precious heart  
  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
We could live  
For a thousand years  
But if I hurt you  
I'd make wine from your tears  
  
I told you  
That we could fly  
'Cause we all have wings  
But some of us don't know why  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never ever tear us apart


Never been a girl who used to cry  
Didn't show emotions, don't know why  
Didn't wanna feel the pain inside, I guess  
  
But as the years keep going by,  
You came along and changed my mind  
I should leave the past behind me,  
I should let you find me,  
Supposed to stay beside me  
You were supposed to guide me,  
Through the ups and downs,  
You were always gonna be around until the end  
  
I still think we could  
'Cause you and me, we're good  
And I'll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I'm sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
So I'm gonna get myself another drink  
Whenever I start to think about you  
'Cause I do what I really don't want to  
But sometimes my dreams just come through  
  
And when I get there,  
To a place where I see you in a kitchen  
I stop wishing but that thing and I don't need you,  
I don't really wanna see youAnd I don't want you to see me,  
You would think that I was crazy,  
You might think that I wanna be close to you  
But I'd rather wanna drink some Whisky  
And maybe have a little sip 'o wine  
'Cause right now it's the only thing that makes me forget you are mine  
But right now I am sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
I still think we could  
(I'm not drunk enough)  
'Cause you and me, we're good  
'Cause I'm sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
(I still think we could)  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
('cause you and me we're good)  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough


You've been on my mind  
I grow fonder every day  
Lose myself in time  
Just thinking of your face  
God only knows why it's taken me  
So long to let my doubts go  
You're the only one that I want  
  
I don't know why I'm scared  
I've been here before  
Every feeling, every word  
I've imagined it all  
You'll never know if you never try  
To forget your past and simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me the chance  
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
If I've been on your mind  
You hang on every word I say  
Lose yourself in time  
At the mention of my name  
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close  
And have you tell me  
Whichever road I choose, you'll go?  
  
I don't know why I'm scared  
'Cause I've been here before  
Every feeling, every word  
I've imagined it all  
You'll never know if you never try  
To forget your past and simply be mine  
  
I dare you to let me be your, your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy, mm  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me the chance  
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart  
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart  
Nobody's perfect  
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)  
Trust me I've learned it  
Nobody's perfect  
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)  
Trust me I've learned it  
Nobody's perfect  
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)  
Trust me I've learned it  
Nobody's perfect  
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)  
Trust me I've learned it  
  
So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only  
I promise I'm worthy  
To hold in your arms  
So come on and give me the chance  
To prove that I am the, one who can walk that mile  
Until the end starts  
  
Come on and give me the chance  
To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile  
Until the end starts


[Verse 1]  
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be  
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe  
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life  
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be  
Every story has its scars  
  
[Chorus]  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy  
Ohhh, ohhh  
  
[Verse 2]  
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you  
Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through  
Your love, it is my truth  
And I will always love you  
Love you, love you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy  
Ohhh, ohhh


Who wants to be right as rain  
It's better when something is wrong  
You get excitement in your bones  
And everything you do's a game  
When night comes and you're on your own  
You can say I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
It's harder when you're on top  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
Who wants to be riding high  
When you'll just crumble back on down  
You give up everything you are  
And even then you don't get far  
They make believe that everything  
Is exactly what it seems  
But at least when you're at your worst  
You know how to feel things  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
Go ahead and still my heart  
To make me cry again  
'Cause it will never hurt  
As much as it did then  
We were both right  
And no one had blame  
But now I give up  
On this endless game  
  
'Cause who wants to be right as rain  
It's better when something is wrong  
I get excitement in my bones  
Even though everything's a strain  
When night comes and I'm on my own  
You should know I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
It's harder when you're on top  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
No room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love


[Verse 1]  
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on  
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young  
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made  
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake  
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch  
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough  
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea  
There was something in the water, now that something's in me  
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
  
[Verse 2]  
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late  
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face  
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance  
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance  
No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips  
I can't go back to the river  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
It's in my roots, it's in my veins  
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea  
  
[Outro]  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
River Lea, River Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea  
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea


There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare  
See how I leave with every piece of you  
Don't underestimate the things that I will do  
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark  
  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared  
  
The scars of your love remind me of us (You're gonna wish you never had met
me)  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling
in the deep)  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling  
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
  
We could've had it all  
Rolling in the deep  
You had my heart inside your hand  
But you played it with a beating  
  
Throw your soul through every open door  
Count your blessings to find what you look for  
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow  
  
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all  
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
It all, it all, it all, (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
  
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)  
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it  
To the beat


She, she ain't real,  
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,  
She is a stranger,  
You and I have history,  
Or don't you remember  
Sure, she's got it all,  
But, baby, is that really what you want  
  
Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds,  
You made a fool out of you,  
And, boy, she's bringing you down,  
She made your heart melt,  
But you're cold to the core,  
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
She is half your age,  
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed,  
I heard you've been missing me,  
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,  
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,  
Haven't you heard the rumors  
  
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,  
You made a fool out of me,  
And, boy, you're bringing me down,  
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,  
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
All of these words whispered in my ear,  
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,  
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,  
People say crazy things,  
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,  
Just 'cause you heard it  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for.

[Intro]  
Just the guitar?  
Okay, cool  
  
[Verse 1]  
This was all you, none of it me  
You put your hands on on my body and told me  
Told me you were ready  
For the big one, for the big jump  
I'd be your last love everlasting, you and me  
Mmm, that was what you told me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was too strong, you were trembling  
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)  
Mmm, baby I'm so rising  
I was running, you were walking  
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)  
Mmm, there's only one way down  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
  
[Bridge]  
If you're ready, if you're ready  
If you're ready, I am ready  
If you're ready, if you're ready  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
No, we ain't kids no more  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm giving you up  
I've forgiven it all  
You set me free, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
Send my love to your new lover  
Treat her better  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
  
[Outro]  
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)  
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more  
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)  
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)  
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts  
We both know we ain't kids no more


I let it fall, my heart,  
And as it fell you rose to claim it  
It was dark and I was over  
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me  
  
My hands, they're strong  
But my knees were far too weak  
To stand in your arms  
Without falling to your feet  
  
But there's a side to you  
That I never knew, never knew  
All the things you'd say  
They were never true, never true  
And the games you play  
You would always win, always win  
  
[Chorus]  
But I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well, it burned while I cried  
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,  
Your name  
  
When I lay with you  
I could stay there  
Close my eyes  
Feel you here forever  
You and me together nothing gets better  
  
'Cause there's a side to you  
That I never knew, never knew  
All the things you'd say  
They were never true, never true  
And the games you play  
You would always win, always win  
  
But I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well, it burned while I cried  
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,  
Your name  
  
I set fire to the rain  
And I threw us into the flames  
Well, it felt something died  
'Cause I knew that that was  
The last time, the last time  
  
Sometimes I wake up by the door,  
That heart you caught must be waiting for you  
Even now when we're already over  
I can't help myself from looking for you  
  
I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well, it burned while I cried  
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,  
Your name  
  
I set fire to the rain,  
And I threw us into the flames  
Well, it felt something died  
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time  
The last time  
  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Let it burn


Find yourself a girl  
And settle down  
Live a simple life  
In a quiet town  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
So steady as she goes  
  
Your friends have shown  
A kink  
In the single life  
You've had  
Too much to think  
Now you need a wife  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Well here we go again  
You've found yourself  
A friend  
That knows you well  
But no matter  
What you do  
You'll always feel  
As though you  
Tripped and fell  
  
So steady as she goes  
  
When you have completed  
What you thought  
You had to do  
And your blood's  
Depleted  
To the point  
Of stable glue  
  
Then you'll get along  
Then you'll get along  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Well here we go again  
You've found yourself  
A friend  
That knows you well  
But no matter  
What you do  
You'll always feel  
As though you  
Tripped and fell  
  
So steady as she goes  
Steady as she goes  
  
Settle for a girl  
(Settle for a girl)  
Neither up or down  
(Neither up or down)  
Sell it to the crowd  
(Sell it to the crowd)  
That is gathered round  
(That is gathered round)  
  
Settle for a girl  
(Settle for a girl)  
Neither up or down  
(Neither up or down)  
Sell it to the crowd  
(Sell it to the crowd)  
That is gathered round  
(That is gathered round)  
  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
So steady as she goes  
(Steady as she goes)  
  
Steady as she go  
Are you steady now?  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
Steady as she goes  
Are you steady now?  
  
Steady as she goes


Didn't I give it all?  
Tried my best  
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less  
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?  
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round  
Still how can you walk away  
From all my tears  
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
Maybe I should leave, to help you see  
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need  
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily  
I thought you loved me more than this  
  
But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
I will change if I must  
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust  
Oh if only, if only you knew  
Everything I do, is for you  
  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all, with my love  
Take it all with my love  
Take it all with my love


When we used  
To say goodnight  
I'd always kiss  
And hold you tight  
But lately  
You don't seem  
To care  
You close the door  
And leave me  
Standing there  
Oh, honey  
That's not fair  
That's it  
I quit  
I'm movin' on  
  
The other night  
We had a date  
An you showed up  
Two hours late  
And though your hair  
Was all in place  
Somebody smeared  
Their lipstick  
On your face  
Yeah she smeared it  
Every place  
Ye that's it honey  
I quit I'm movin' on  
  
Oooohhhh  
  
You made me want you  
You made me leave you  
You made me tumble  
And fall  
But if I  
Can't have you the way  
I want you  
I don't want you at all  
  
Baby, I can take a lot  
Cause I love  
Everything you got  
Though your kisses  
Fill me  
So if you got  
Someone else  
I gotta go  
Oh, that you know  
Yeah that's it honey  
I quit I'm movin' on  
  
Oooohhhh  
  
You made me want you  
You made me leave you  
You made me tumble  
And fall  
But if I  
Can't have you the way  
I want you  
I don't want you at all  
  
Baby  
I can take a lot  
Cause I love  
Everything you got  
Though your kisses  
Fill me  
So if you got  
Someone else  
I gotta go  
Oh, that you know  
So that's it baby  
I quit I'm movin' on  
So that's it baby  
I quit now  
Oh I'm movin' on


Hold my hand while you cut me down  
It had only just begun but now it's over now  
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold  
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold  
In my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night  
The night  
Fell off your mind  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired  
  
Where'd you go when you stayed behind  
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find  
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile  
I get closer you obviously prefer her  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Boy I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired  
  
(I should have known)  
  
Never mind said your open arms  
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though  
  
I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Boy I'm tired of trying  
Your teasing ain't enough  
Fed up of biding your time  
When I don't get nothing back  
And for what, and for what, and for what  
When I don't get nothing back  
Oy, I'm tired


Close enough to start a war  
All that I have is on the floor  
God only knows what we're fighting for  
All that I say, you always say more  
  
I can't keep up with your turning tables  
Under your thumb, I can't breathe  
  
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me  
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me  
I can't give you, what you think you gave me  
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables  
To turning tables  
  
Under haunted skies I see you  
Where love is lost, your ghost is found  
I braved a hundred storms to leave you  
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down  
  
I can't keep up with your turning tables  
Under your thumb, I can't breathe  
  
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no  
I won't ask you, you to just desert me  
I can't give you, what you think you gave me  
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables  
Turning tables  
  
Next time I'll be braver  
I'll be my own savior  
When the thunder calls for me  
Next time I'll be braver  
I'll be my own savior  
Standing on my own two feet  
  
I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no  
I won't ask you, you to just desert me  
I can't give you, what you think you gave me  
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables  
To turning tables  
Turning tables, yeah  
Turning oh


[Verse 1]  
If you're not the one for me  
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?  
If you're not the one for me  
Why do I hate the idea of being free?  
And if I'm not the one for you  
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do  
Oh and if I'm not the one for you  
Why have we been through what we have been through?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It's so cold out here in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless  
  
[Chorus]  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
Woaah, woaaah  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
  
[Verse 2]  
What are you waiting for?  
You never seem to make it through the door  
And who are you hiding from?  
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run  
Have I ever asked for much?  
The only thing that I want is your love  
  
[Chorus]  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
Woaah, woaaah  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It's so cold in your wilderness  
I want you to be my keeper  
But not if you are so reckless  
  
[Chorus]  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently  
Don't pretend that you don't want me  
Our love ain't water under the bridge  
  
[Outro]  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge  
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge


[Verse 1]  
Everybody loves the things you do  
From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It looks like a movie  
It sounds like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was so scared to face my fears  
Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You still look like a movie  
You still sound like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
  
[Bridge]  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Verse 3]  
It's hard to admit that  
Everything just takes me back  
To when you were there  
To when you were there  
And a part of me keeps holding on  
Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Bridge]  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
I'm so mad I'm getting old  
It makes me reckless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
When we were young
