[Verse:]  
It's another, if it ain't one thing  
Instigators, like pouring fire on propane  
The wrong thing, they be worried about  
Ooh, you know females  
And how they like to run their mouths  
  
Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you  
(like you) you (like you)  
Misery, misery, best company  
Don't let them change your mood  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Between us, they wanna comment  
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend  
Perfect, ain't saying that I am  
Proven, it's proven I don't give a damn  
  
Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)  
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy  
Jealous of you  
That's what they do  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad


Sitting here all alone watching the snow fall  
Looking back at the days when we threw them snowballs  
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself  
I need you and nobody else  
I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
And I never wanna do this alone  
Baby I just need you to be here  
Here through the holidays, yeah  
I just wanna know if you feel the same way  
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby  
  
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
I just want you to know I miss you  
And I want you to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
Wrapping gifts without you baby  
Is like mid December and there's no cold  
I can't do this on my own (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
I've changed my ways  
We keep running back and forth again  
I'm here to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas


As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me  
  
We're under pressure,  
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in  
Keep it together,  
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning  
But hey now, you know girl,  
We both know it's a cruel world  
But I will take my chances

Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,  
I'll beat ya there  
Girl you know I got you  
Us, trust  
A couple of things I can't spell without you  
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do  
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view  
Man now we stepping out like whoa (oh God)  
Camera's point and shoot,  
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you  
You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,  
It's green where you water it  
So I know we got issues baby true true true  
But I'd rather work on this with you  
Than to go ahead and start with someone new  
As long as you love me  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

Put me in a outfit from the gap like that. One that  
Matches  
With the jacket and the cap like that.  
Then slap me in the stroller with the bounce like that.  
With the bottle full of milk that's 40 ounce like that.  
I'm your b-baby lady.  
Tina - I wanna push you in the buggy.  
I'm your b-baby lady,  
I wanna hold you like a Snuggie.  
You're my baby, lady.  
Tina - And I'm your lady, baby.  
It's time to roll,  
Let's go to the park.

[Verse 1]  
Feeling the reminisce  
Gone in an instance  
Blink of an eye  
No goodbye  
I had a notion  
Deep as the ocean  
Blue like the sky  
Oh my  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
But we're the blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
(Woah, woah, woah)  
If I had the chance  
If I had the chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Verse 2]  
There repercussion  
Of missing your loving  
Haunts me at night  
The ghosts are alive  
All of the memories  
Of serenity  
Dwindle in my mind  
All the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
Who was to blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you

How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
You were my sun  
You were my earth  
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no  
  
You know why?  
Cause in the night, I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
That's why I said,  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said "what's up?"  
Yeah, I'm gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh  
  
I want the money, money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful, yeah, said  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful


Oh, oh, oh  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how  
No one has a solid answer  
Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's up to you and it's up to me  
That we meet in the middle  
On our way back down to earth  
Down to earth, down to earth  
On our way back down to earth  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
  
Mommy you were always somewhere  
And Daddy I live outta town  
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how  
You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We fell so far away from where we used to be  
Now we're standing, and where do we go  
When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how.

Then it gave a lil' flicker then  
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,  
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,  
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,  
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,  
I said cool, cool,  
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger,  
Before we work I gotta get this off,  
See the other family members and drop gifts off,  
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,

Let me tell you a story  
About a girl and a boy  
He fell in love with his best friend when she's around,  
He feels nothing but joy  
But she was already broken,  
And it made her blind  
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right  
But did you know that I loved you  
Or were you not aware?  
Well you're the smile on my face  
And I ain't going nowhere  
I'm here to make you happy,  
I'm here to see you smile  
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while  
  
Who's gonna make you fall  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
Well I can tell you're afraid of  
What this might do  
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose  
Well I don't wanna lose it either  
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe  
So take my hand  
Well did you know you're an angel  
Who forgot how to fly?  
And did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry  
'Cause I know that it piece of you is gone every time he done wrong  
I'm the shoulder you're crying on  
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song, I figure out  
  
What's gonna make you fall in love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
I will catch you if you fall  
I will catch you if you fall  
Well I will catch you if you fall  
And if you spread your wings  
You can fly away with me  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
Let yourself fall oh baby

Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing  
Said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it  
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me  
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what imma do now

I know I told you last time was the last time  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Flatline [x2]  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?


I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
Girl it's getting late, the sun's going down  
And it's about the time to shake my cross the town  
But before I go, I just wanna say  
That you stay on my mind each and everyday  
  
I think I'm starting to like  
The time that we spend  
And it's building inside  
Then I can't pretend  
  
No I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel  
So I guess it's time for me to say  
That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
Don't know if is love, it's too early to say  
But if it's something like it I just want it to remain  
Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time  
But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine  
Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before  
And if it's a hint of what's to come then maybe can I get some more?  
  
Not trying to be too forward, but I think it's best for you to know  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me

[Verse 1]  
Subjected to my system  
Reflecting on the days  
When we used to be just friends  
Protected both our interest  
Our trust was in a bank  
That's where our hearts were safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And then we got closer  
Separated from my ex  
Til we got closure  
Oh, in every visit  
Feelings got stronger  
Now this is out our hands  
Our love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I'm a April shower you  
Forever if I May  
'Til your flowers bloom in June  
Make sure that our fireworks  
Be your 4th of July  
For life  
As long as you stand right by my side  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Keep growing closer  
Throughout October  
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve  
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve  
Then we'll be celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Bridge]  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
Put your faith in me  
I'll be all you need, I swear  
Yeah yeah  
I'm gonna be right here, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face

I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh

Since the first day I met her I knew she was the one  
Or  
I know she's the one I've been searching for all my life  
Or  
There's not a day that I could go without her, I have to see her beautiful
face  
Or  
Every time I'm with her I fell like if I'm dreaming  
Or  
I just can't stop thinking about her  
Or  
I love everything about her, there's not one thing that I'll ever change about
her  
Or  
There's something about her that makes me fall in love with her within
everyday  
Or  
It's like a dream come true, I still can't believe how a pretty lady like her
fell in love with me  
Or  
She's the best girlfriend I've had so far  
Well that's all I got for now!


Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)  
Since you been away, oh baby  
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go  
'Cause I really wanna be alone  
And baby nobody else gotta know  
Just meet me later on the low  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
  
Girl you see me standing here (standing here)  
Standing in the rain(oh baby)  
Any chance that you could stay right here  
And never go away  
  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go (secret place that we can go)  
'Cause I really wanna be alone (I really wanna be alone)  
And baby nobody else gotta know (nobody else)  
Just meet me later on the low (would you meet me on the low, girl)  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (baby don't tell me, no)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (oh baby)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking (heart is breaking)  
  
So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand  
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man  
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around  
But, this is, this is personal, this is, for me and you  
And I want you to know that I still love you  
And I know the seasons may change  
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain  
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name  
And you know I don't wanna lose that  
  
(I still believe)  
I still believe in love  
I still believe in us  
I hope you believe in us  
The way I believe in us  
  
You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak  
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya  
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your baby jeans  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart  
Be careful with your heart


I always see the girls walk past me  
But they really don't know what I'm like  
I'm funny, talented and stupid  
I hate boys because they try to take my women  
They get on my nerves so I start pokin  
  
So I keep on saying  
I can't stand guys  
They have ugly eyes  
They smell like cats  
And are fats  
They are so stupid  
They act like cupid  
But they don't know I I am your man  
Ha  
(Your man)  
Lalalala  
(Your man)


[Verse 1]  
Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away  
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe  
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too  
I'm just tryna keep this love on track  
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Holding you close to my heart  
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach  
Damn these seats go way back  
I was thinking about way back  
When we used to say that  
I was yours, you were mine  
And we fought to pass the time  
And I realized, I realized, that we  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what (oh)  
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart


[Verse 1]  
My life is a movie and everyone's watching  
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way  
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
  
[Outro: Acoustic]  
I'll show you  
I'll show you

I feel the chemistry,  
Yeah we got it made,  
A little kiss is a definite possibility,  
Seen you a couple times,  
Had a couple conversations,  
Since you've been on my mind,  
Had a couple observations,  
  
If you a fly chick,  
You could be my chick,  
Play by the rules and  
You could get what I get,

Don't need that tmz,  
All in our privacy,

If you wanna ride with me,  
  
And if you wanna tell somebody,  
Then we can call the whole thing off,  
No Problem

And I'll go mine,  
But I'd rather spend a little time with you,  
Yeah,

Kiss and tell  
  
Oh,

You keep this private,  
And you can get what I get,  
(Ohh)

If you're gonna kiss and tell  
No, no, no  
If you're gonna kiss and tell,  
If you're gonna kiss and tell,  
That's not me


Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it ain't over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
  
Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin' down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent us an angel to help us out  
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't ever over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
Life is worth living again  
  
What I'd give for my affection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I ain't perfect, won't deny  
My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again


My friends say I'm a fool  
To think that you're the one for me  
I guess I'm just a sucker for love  
'Cause honestly the truth is  
That you know I'm never leavin'  
'Cause you're my angel sent from above  
  
Baby you can do no wrong  
My money is yours  
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya  
With me, girl, is where you belong  
Just stay right here  
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
People try to tell me  
But I still refuse to listen  
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you  
A minute with you is worth more than  
A thousand days without your love, oh your love  
  
Oh, baby you can do no wrong  
My money is yours  
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya  
With me, girl, is where you belong  
Just stay right here  
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
My heart is blind but I don't care  
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared  
And every time I hold you near  
I never wanna let you go, oh  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me


Walkin on red dirt no concrete pavement  
Navy blue book bag on my back  
  
Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station  
Hope they let me ride away with them  
  
Got pretty mad at my father today  
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say  
  
As I'm singin an old song she used to sing  
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
So I turn around and headed to the old run down building  
Bells gonna ring before I make it back  
  
I watch the upper class men drive right past me  
Wish they'd let me ride away with them  
  
Still haven't got over it yet  
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear  
  
My ipods the same tune my mother would sing  
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
Never get mad enough to walk out  
If I do then I won't be gone for long  
  
Never fed up enough to leave her  
No matter what I'll love her just the same  
  
That's my mama  
Yeah  
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away  
Run away, yeah  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't


I chasing a  
Ilucion this down  
The moon shows me a  
Shortcut to town.  
This is strange, strange I know  
But what else can we do?  
  
Show me all, all around  
Not to trip, I want hear a sound...  
But longer be - be - be bound  
Here we go!

Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is very extreme  
Woohha-a-ohooh

That you and I are my love!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
  
As in the horror movie to be lame  
I just love these here is the same  
A small and neglect is the end  
No no the end... Yeah!  
Finds it a new way to say now  
Commenters a way to feel now  
This is live, my love, your ball  
Back to losing control.  
  
Woohha-a-ohooh  
Is like a dream  
Woohha-a-ohooh

Woohha-a-ohooh  
The perfect team  
That you and I are my love!

Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!

I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
  
A misstep -tep (x8)  
  
Now my love  
Loses control  
And  
Back home  
Here we go!  
Look the sun  
Everything is fun,  
And  
Look the moon  
I wanna know  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep  
  
You know that love is well  
A misstep - tep  
Wooah!


Never say never (never never never)  
  
You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)  
I never thought that I could take the burn  
I never had the strength to take it higher  
Until I reach the point of no return  
  
And there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
Never say it, never, never say it  
  
I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)  
I never thought that I could feel this free  
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)  
  
'Cause there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
'Cause this is my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Here we go  
Guess who?  
J-Smith and J-B!  
I gotcha lil' bro  
I can handle him  
Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Never say never  
  
I will never say never (never say never)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
  
And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
And never say never

First, I'll acknowledge  
All trust has been broken  
A successful recovery  
I pray for us at night  
  
Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
Just tryna make it right.  
  
Make it right  
Make it right  
Make it right  
This time I'll do you right  
  
Missing your good intentions  
Missing you from a distance  
Hope you did the same  
  
I know that I caused a problem  
Know that I left you livid  
Pushed you far away  
  
Learned it don't pay to lie  
Cause I don't wanna see you cry  
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast

But now that I'm back around ya  
Nothing else really matters  
Hope you feel the same

Trying to find a reason  
That we ended that way  
  
Nothing in life is perfect  
We'll be changing like the seasons  
That's what they used to say

Wanna give you all I have to give

All about money tied in a know stand over there

Next show they gotta up the zeroes  
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old  
  
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me

The young youth rocking the gold tooth  
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules  
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'

Grabbing em on set

Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes  
Even the stress  
  
My mind is a terrible thing to waste  
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss

So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling

[Verse:]  
She dances in the sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances 'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep...  
  
She dances at the break of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She can't be late, can't take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
  
She dances for the men at work  
Who works her all the time  
She can't be rude as she says so  
"I must be home tonight"  
  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
She sets his food an hour late  
She must be out of her mind...  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She works so hard, just to make her way  
For a man who just won't appreciate  
  
And don't know it takes  
And was all in vain.  
Still she could not stop,  
Couldn't break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore she'd dance no more  
But then she did, she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home, home  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love


Mmmm mmm yeah  
Do do do do do do do-do  
Ohh Yeah  
  
Gotta change my answering machine  
Now that I'm alone  
Cuz right now it says that we  
Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
Cuz you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
It's ridiculous  
It's been months  
And for some reason I just  
Can't get over us  
And I'm stronger than this  
Enough is enough  
No more walkin round  
With my head down  
I'm so over being blue  
Cryin over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
I'm letting go  
Turning off the radio  
  
Cuz I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishin' you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?


With you,  
With you,  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place  
  
Now Romeo and Juliet,  
Bet they never felt the way we felt,  
Bonnie and Clyde,  
Never had to hide like,  
We do,  
We do  
  
You and I both know it can't work,  
It's all fun and games,  
'Til someone gets hurt,  
And I don't,  
I won't let that be you  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
There might be something real between us two, who knew?  
Now we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
'Cause I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like Adam and Eve,  
Tragedy was our destiny,  
Like Sunny and Cher,  
I don't care,  
I got you baby  
  
See we both,  
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,  
'Cause ain't no way,  
It's gonna end right but,  
We are both too foolish to stop  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?  
And we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
And I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like,  
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be,  
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,  
And I ain't with it,  
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,  
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,  
But convention's telling us to let go,  
So we'll never know  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
'Cause everything we did,  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do,  
(Nothing my heart can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause, (and space)  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you,  
Yeah,

Everybody's laughing in my mind

That should be me, making you laugh  
That should be me, this is so sad

Now if you're trying to break my heart  
It's working cause you know

Or disarm

Why does she even obsess about her life with me  
She's like "I don't need you! Just let me be!"  
Why doesn't she ever care me, you see  
Well I'm done with her and she's done with me!  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress  
  
(Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) (2x)  
  
Flashback, we were nice and cuddly then  
But then you broke my heart and let go of my hand  
Didn't this of this relationship to end like this  
You could have just gave me a hug or kiss (on the cheek)  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress  
  
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (4x)  
  
Hey!  
What do you say?  
That girl is never coming back today  
Hey!  
What do you say?  
She never wants to see me anyway  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress (2x)  
  
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (Repeat until end)

All night, all smiles, we we're holding hands.  
And now you won't shre the bed with me  
Explain if you can  
  
We may not agree on this, but let's not fight.  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
Taken by surprise, because I felt so secure.  
Because all the things, that you've done,  
Have let me wondering  
  
We may not agree on this, but let's not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breath like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words.  
  
We can say that we've changed, together  
Another day--give me your hand, let me  
Explain, because I've come to terms with  
Who you are.  
  
We may not agree on this but let's not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your grip  
Is too tight--let's not fight, your grip is too.  
Is too--tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words.


I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
And I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
'Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children  
Laughter fills the air  
  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
  
Oh I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas  
Is you, baby  
  
It's all I want for Christmas  
It's all I want for Christmas  
It's all I want for babe,  
All I want, all I really want is you baby  
All I want, all I really want is, want is, want is, want is  
Ooh baby


Oh oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky  
I need you to shine in my life  
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time  
Better believe it  
  
Oh oh, whenever you're not in my presence  
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah  
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night  
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah  
  
You think I'm biased  
To my significant other  
You hit it right on the head  
Only been missing my lover  
Got a whole lotta texts in my phone and I don't reply  
The next eight bars tell you why  
  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah,  
Ain't worried about nobody else  
If it ain't you, I ain't myself  
You make me complete  
  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah,  
What's a king bed without a queen  
There ain't no "I" in team  
You make me complete  
You're all that matters to me  
  
Take the gas out the car it won't drive  
That's how I feel when you're not by my side  
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you  
  
Oh oh, grateful for your existence  
Faithful no matter the distance  
You're the only girl I see  
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You are my love, you are my heart  
And we will never, ever, ever be apart  
  
Are we an item? Girl quit playin'  
We're just friends, what are you sayin'  
Said there's another, look right in my eyes  
My first love, broke my heart for the first time  
  
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh

I'll buy you any ring  
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me  
And just shake me, til you wake me from this bad dream

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love  
There was nobody that compared to my baby  
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above  
She had me goin' crazy  
Oh I was starstruck  
She woke me up daily  
Don't need no Starbucks  
She made my heart pound  
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and  
At school on the playground  
But I really wanna see her on the weekend  
She know she got me dazin'  
'Cause she was so amazin'  
And now my heart is breakin'  
But I just keep on sayin'  
  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)

Across the ocean, across the sea,  
Starting to forget the way you look at me now  
Over the mountains, across the sky,  
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes  
  
Through the storm and through the clouds  
Bumps on the road and upside down now  
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
All alone, in my room  
Waiting for your phone call to come soon  
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,  
To be in your arms, holding my heart  
  
Oh I,  
Oh I,  
I love you  
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the long nights  
And the bright lights  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
You know that I care for you  
I'll always be there for you  
I promise I will stay right here, yeah  
  
I know that you want me too,  
Baby we can make it through anything  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
Everything's gonna be alright

Gotta believe in me  
Believe me like a fairytale  
Put your tooth under your pillowcase  
And know I won't I won't  
Ever ever let you down (no)  
Like a seesaw let you down (oh)  
You know why  
'Cause we ain't in the playground no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
Whoa oh  
Remember when my heart was young  
You were still bigger than me  
Is that the reason that you stayed  
Most would've got rid of me  
Now the bully's in the school yard  
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us  
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker

(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like yesterday  
(They shine on me) We were little then  
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby  
You wow wow (You wow wow)  
Since then all I can remember is the love only got bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger

A heart-breaker  
When I was little

Verse 1:  
I messed up the first part of our love. I messed up our relationship. I know
what we had came from above. But I don't know if this is it. Every day I talk
to your picture. Hangin on my wall. Sayin how much I miss her, I miss it
all...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 2:  
I messed up your life. I messed up my time. I know what we had was all right.
But I don't know if you cry at night. Sayin to your parents, saying I am bad.
Telling them. "he was all that I had."  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 3:  
What we had is dead and gone. It will be too long. Before me and you are
together. But I guess not anymore...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
(Yeah) (yeah) woahhhh! (yeah) (yeah) can't get you off my mind.


[Verse:]  
I just sit here waiting for you to call  
Then I wonder if you're even calling at all  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm still sitting here waiting for much more (Text me or something)  
I can't take this, I'm walking out that door  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I pack up my things and get on that plane  
Cause without you I can't be tamed  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Bridge:]  
Please girl stay with me  
My heart is waiting for you  
I can't take this no more  
There's nothing I should do  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without  
  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you


The sun comes up on another morning  
My mind never wakes up without you on it  
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams  
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?  
  
We were best of friends since we were this high  
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by  
We would be on the phone all day  
Now I can't find the words to say to you  
Now what I'm supposed to do  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
In my head we're already together  
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better  
I just wanna see you smile  
You say the word and I'll be right there  
I ain't never going nowhere  
  
I'm just trying to see where this can take us  
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious  
I think I finally got it done  
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror  
And say it to her, her yeah  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)  
Or should I moving closer just be still  
How would I know?  
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand  
Will everything change?  
How do I know if she feels the same?  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Catching feelings, catching feelings


[Verse]  
What about the children?  
Look at all the children we can change  
What about a vision?  
Be a visionary for a change  
We're the generation  
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?  
We're the inspiration  
Do you believe enough to die for it?  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Oh yeah  
  
Who's got the heart?  
Oh yeah

Just hang your stockings on the fireplace  
You know that Santa's coming to town  
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now  
  
So today is all about you babe  
The mistletoe can pull us closer  
It's what I'm waiting for  
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's  
  
So in on top of your roof  
Them sleigh bells is ringing

Don't care what they're saying

Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
You leave some cookies out,

Nobody can see me but you

The North Pole, ain't that cold

I can see  
All the children around the world  
Crying tears of deceit  
And their parents are to blame  
Christmas is dead  
And that children should cry no more  
All of it is just fake  
There's no sense to believing in  
Putting your kids health at risk  
And its causing mental illnesses around the world  
So, Christmas is dead  
And pretend its just another day  
  
Santa claus is fake  
And children will cry  
In order to admit the truth  
When you say Christmas is the perfect time of year  
I should put you to the test  
I will say  
You are careless  
That's wrong  
And you'll understand  
How the truth will set you free and change you  
Christmas is dead


Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away  
  
Tv light of blue and white  
Just can't fall asleep at night  
Move over to the space where you should be  
Even half way seem so far  
Over mountains and diamond stars  
Everybody has their own way home  
  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
All my life I've dreamed of love  
Never thought it would hurt this much  
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return  
So I'll be strong and hold on to  
A picture and a thought of you  
Getting all the love that you deserve  
  
So come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away


Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again, woo woo woo  
You're the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me,  
Is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
Girl, without you I'm lost  
Can't face this compass at heart  
Between me and love,  
You're the common denominator  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Common denominator  
Oh, yeah, woa  
  
Before you're love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side, aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say,  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be love's reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin'  
Imma hold it down for you, you  
You, woah, oh, woah  
You're the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I don't wanna go back  
I don't want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again


Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright,

Say you love me  
As much as I love you yeah  
Would you hurt me baby  
Could you do that to me yeah  
Would you lie to me baby  
'Cause the truth hurts so much more  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy  
Leave my heart still at the door?  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl  
  
(Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright) Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy  
But it sure is worth a try  
  
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool  
'Cause I love too hard  
Are there any rules baby  
If this a lesson  
Then baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl

It's your chance take her hand to the floor (when I walk to the floor)  
Girl if you see something you like then let him know  
'Cause you only got one chance, for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance  
So take advantage of the slow dance  
  
When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,  
We've both been waiting so long  
For this day to come  
Now that it's here lets make it special  
I can't deny  
There's so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be  
The night of our dreams  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me  
I'm gonna cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a life time  
  
I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth  
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor  
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night  
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close  
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know  
Before the lights go up and the music turns off  
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,  
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll  
Make it before the clock strikes nine  
  
If you just give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

If it has some wings, we'd be flying, we'd be soaring  
Ah-ah-ah

No-o-o  
But I'm thinking that you're winning if you make it to the top  
That probably means you make me feel some type of way  
Shout-out Miami for having so many foreign babes

Came with the girls and they tryna leave with me  
She workin' hard like she tryna get a visa  
The way she twerk it I just might pull out my Visa

I have often dreamed  
Of a far off place  
Where a hero's welcome  
Would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer  
When they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying  
This is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday  
I can go the distance  
I will find my way  
If I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while  
When I go the distance  
I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road  
To embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander  
It will lead me to you  
And a thousand years  
Would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime  
But somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back  
I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track  
No, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope  
But I won't lose hope  
'Till I go the distance  
And my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star  
I will go the distance  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far  
I can go the distance  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms

Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
Don't be afraid to stand alone  
Don't be afraid to stand outside all by yourself  
I know it's hard away from home  
It ain't easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin' to your significant other all night long  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
[Pooh Bear]  
Should've been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now you're standin' right in front of me  
It is mean and though, that life  
Try to protect your feelins  
Givin' in between the lines  
Hope your heart is totally healed and  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality


But yesterday we were  
I don't understand?  
  
We started out it was perfect  
Nothing but fun  
And my heart was convinced  
To say that you're the one  
  
And I thought it would last the rest of our lives  
Boy was I in for a big surprise,  
With no doubt looking round  
Thinking that I'm so cool  
  
Same place, same time  
Every day of my life could we meet after school  
Finally if I didn't make her cry  
She wouldn't be with another guy  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Now I'm all tore up taking up  
When I was at your door  
For the first time when you said  
Forever I'll be yours  
Started walking your hand in my hand  
Feelings got stronger  
  
We made a promise.  
  
And whenever I leave it feels like you're still with me  
But it all came crashing down  
Sitting in my room  
I gotta get out of here  
What am I to do when I look up  
And you're not there.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Say I'm to young for love  
I got so much live to live ahead  
But if only this love?  
I could get over  
I know I have to deal with the pain.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here


[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you love me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you loved me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Take it one day at a time  
Reach for the stars now  
Ooh just leave the past behind  
That's a part of living, woah  
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah  
  
[Outro]  
If only I could hit the ground  
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be falling down  
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be touching down  
If only I could hit the ground


Every birthday, every birthday  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Don't let this go to your head  
But you're the best, I've ever had  
Not to mention  
That thing is swollen  
You got me oh so in a trance  
  
Something like a Ziploc, but a lip lock  
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch  
Oh, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Got me tossing, turning in the bed  
Your place is where I rather be instead  
You don't know your strength  
Missing you is like adrenaline  
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock  
What a great spot  
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won't stop  
No, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go, no babay  
  
Holding back the faces I would make  
I'm a fan and you're the rock star  
Making it hard on me  
Visualize a monster  
'Cause you're too bad for me  
Shot that arrow, I'm hit  
Need you right near me  
Trying to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away (no, no)  
I try to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go


Looking out the window  
Waiting for your headlights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight  
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Pacing down the hallway  
Trying to fight the urge to call  
I could almost hear a pin drop  
'Cept for the clock on the wall  
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
I'm praying that you make it home tonight  
So we can lay down by the fireside  
You and I till Christmas morning  
There's nothing else that I want this year  
More than just to have you here, whoa  
I'll be waiting  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Looking out the window  
Waiting for your head lights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight

I don't work hard when it's easy  
I put in work when it's hard  
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours  
This is more than a season  
And I'm not just sprung  
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one  
But when I wake up thinking 'bout  
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down  
Life is so good when you're around  
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now  
Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends  
Cause you don't come with drama  
So I want you till the world ends  
You're way more than worth it  
But I don't feel like I deserve it  
You got the pieces  
You're my kind of perfect

Verse 1:  
The strands in your eyes  
They color them wonderful  
Stop me was stealing my breath  
The emeralds from mountains  
The thrust toward the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me  
That we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartbreak  
That hang from above  
  
Chorus:  
And i'll be you're crying shoulder  
I'll be love suicide  
And i'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
(x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
I've dropped out

Repeat Chorus

Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?

She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it  
It ain't a problem, baby girl when you're with it  
Tell me what you wanna do, would you make a move now?

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me  
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 B-T  
I asked her what's her name - got the note she said Hammer  
On the way to the mattress, said she loved the Panamera  
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers  
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae in the pot when I beat it  
Take her across the country, I got plugs on the Visa  
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him  
  
[Verse 4: Takeoff]  
He never seen a nigga like me  
Hoppin' out the Chevy, step up with the minks, gold chain, Mr. T  
In the summer, with the beach, with the hummer, with the leather seat  
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I bet they watching me  
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli  
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch calling me call me your majesty  
  
[Verse 5: Offset]  
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage  
I run to the money like Forrest  
My life is historic  
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit  
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon  
I watch her like a telescope  
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil Terrio  
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows  
I'm young and always riding in a Phantom Ghost  
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night

[Verse 1]  
For all the times that you rain on my parade  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness' sake  
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Bridge]  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself


[Verse 1]  
Love is in the air  
Candles all around us  
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing  
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever  
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Babe, you are the reason to breathe  
And babe, you know you're all that I need  
Remember when you took my hand  
And ran away (it was just us two babe)  
And wandered off to Chinatown  
Laughing 'bout nothing at all  
When I look into your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)

She says she met me on a tour  
She keeps knocking on my door,  
She won't leave me, leave me alone  
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops  
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, oh  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby,no, she ain't my girl  
But she talking in, and she needs to quit  
But never this, all I know she's not mine  
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl  
  
Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene  
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love  
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth  
She's faking, faking it all  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, yeah  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby, no, she ain't my girl  
But she talking in, and she needs to quit  
But never this, all I know she's not mine  
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl, no  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl  
  
Why are you trying, trying to lie girl  
When ain't I never met you at all  
Saying goodbye, but how could ya  
You throw this, you throw this  
Your foolishness, seduces  
  
Maria why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl  
  
But she talking in, and she needs to quit  
But never this, all I know she's not mine  
That ain't my baby, (that's no my baby) that ain't my girl  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby (she is not my baby), she ain't my girl, no  
  
That ain't my baby (she ain't my baby), that ain't my girl  
She ain't my baby (she ain't my baby), she ain't my girl  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl, yeah  
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl


[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words  
  
[Verse]  
So you heard it all before  
Falling in and out of trust  
Trying to rekindle us  
Only to lose yourself  
But I won't let me lose you  
And I won't let us just fade away  
After all that we've been through  
I'ma show you more than I ever could say  
  
[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words


It's the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Everyone's gatherin' around the fire  
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July  
I should be chillin' with my folks I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
Word on the street Santa's comin' tonight  
Reindeer flyin' through the sky so high  
I should be makin' a list I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
With you, shawty with you

With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Aye love, the Wisemen follow the star, the way I follow my heart  
And it lead me to a miracle, hey love  
Don't ya buy me nothin', 'cause I am feelin' one thing  
Your lips on my lips, that's a merry merry Christmas  
  
It's the most beautiful time of the year

Ooh no, ooh no, ooh  
They say that hate has been sent  
So let loose the talk of love  
Before they outlaw the kiss  
Baby give me one last hug  
  
There's a dream  
That I've been chasing  
Want so badly for it to be reality  
(Reality, reality)  
And when you hold my hand  
Then I understand  
That it's meant to be  
  
Cause baby when you're with me  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go oh no so)

Bring the doubters on  
They don't matter at all  
Cause this life's to long  
And this love's to strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
I got my favorite girl  
Not feelin' no pain or fear  
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)  
Oh no, don't have a care in the world  
Why would I, when you are here  
(You are here, you are here)  
There's a moment I've been chasin'  
And I finally caught it out on this floor  
(On this floor, in this floor)  
  
Baby, there's no hesitation,  
No reservation by taking a chance and more  
Oh no, because  
  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go, oh no so)  
  
Let the music blast  
We gon' do our dance  
Bring the doubters on

Cause this life's too long  
And this love's to strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go

(Don't want you to go, oh, no, so)  
  
Take my hand, lets just dance  
Watch my feet, follow me  
Don't be scared, girl I'm here  
If you didn't know, this is love  
  
(Let the music blast)  
(We gon' do our dance)

Oh baby

That I'll never let you go  
(I'll never let you go)  
  
So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing  
I am here (right here)  
I'll never let you go, ooh  
Don't shed a tear, whenever you need me I'll be near  
I'll never let you go,

[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin' out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Outro: Justin Bieber]  
Hold on me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
One more dance is all I need  
One more dance is all I need

[Verse 1: justin bieber]  
Damn damn j.b, where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds  
2 big face rollies, no I ain't lyin'  
Making momma so proud that she cryin'  
Yeah you say I'm crazy? guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu  
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating  
I swear otis redding will be oh-so ready  
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with kenny  
And we steady getting many, I mean money  
Riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses  
  
[Justin bieber]  
Wait... I'm not done  
  
[Verse 2: justin bieber]  
I thanked jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell  
Call me zack morris I'm saving you by the bell  
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bee's cause baby I'm a money tree  
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y  
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally  
There's a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out, I should make history  
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?  
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot  
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that "it's not mine"  
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry  
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry

And I pray  
  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Knowing that things ain't right  
Its in the papers, its on the TV,  
Its everywhere that I go  
Children are crying  
Soldiers are dying  
Some people don't have a home  
  
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Can you tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
  
I lose my appetite,  
Knowing kids starve tonight  
Am I a sinner,  
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate  
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference  
And its starting today  
  
'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Heaven tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and  
Pray for the broken-hearted  
I pray for the life not started  
I pray for all the lungs not breathing  
I pray for all the souls in need  
I pray  
Can you give 'em one today  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Can someone tell how to make a change?  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and I pray

Can talk to you, you're being rude, and there's no need to cry you departed

Things seemed strange this morning  
As I packed my bags for school  
The smiles I'm used to seein' just weren't there  
I heard my father talking  
To my mother down the hallway  
Above the whispers all that I could hear... Was  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
I was feeling kinda helpless  
About the words that I just heard  
Could it be the family 2 doors down  
They said a couple months of bad luck  
Had them up against the wall  
And though it may seem small  
I know there's something I can do...  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
Make room at your table  
For your friends and family  
Take the time to share your day  
Just laugh talk and eat  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table

There's little hope for you and I

She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark  
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart  
And she getting to the point where it's too much for  
And throw us all away, it's too much for  
She can't hide away 'cause the world knows who we are

Don't want no love in front of the camera  
  
She don't like the lights

She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice  
I can't do that  
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for  
Wanna throw it all away, 'cause it's too much for

Why can I choose between the two  
One of the nights I'll run right now  
I wish she could see, how good this can be  
I hope she waits a little bit longer  
'Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side  
'Cause she gets the light that is in me  
But she don't know, she don't know  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't  
She don't like the lights

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys  
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm December our hearts will see  
A world where men are free  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas we'll see a land  
No hungry children and no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world where people care  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears  
One shining moment my heart ran away  
From our world today  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas man will not fail  
Take hope because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
Someday at Christmas time


[Verse 1]  
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty,  
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies.  
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?  
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness.  
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice,  
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times.  
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight,  
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, yeah,  
Sorry.  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to,  
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two.  
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth,  
Can we both say the words and forget this?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no),  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body, your body!.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

What does it mean when you have nothing to say,  
When the memmories and contant thoguhts wont go away.  
There's something about you that I can't let go  
But if we never meet there's nothing to show.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
You talk to everyone except me.  
How do you expect this thing to be?  
I don't want to say good-bye  
Because you've reailed me in so fast,  
Befor I was tought how.  
  
I go mornings and nights thinking about how it could have been,  
But the pain inside didn't want to give in. And somehow I the tears seem to
fade away.  
Thinking to myself maby one day...  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
Nomater what happens to our love  
I'll always remember your touch,  
And the way you talk  
Ohh, the way you walk.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.

[Justin Bieber]  
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose (Yeah)  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
[Usher]  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
[Both]  
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

Merry Christmas to you!


Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes,  
I'm making you're sadder than you realize  
I could make you smile and feel a little more related.  
We really click, would it be so wrong if we just dated?  
Let us goooo... Jump on my skateboard, eat some cake, along  
The lake  
I'll do all your favorite stuff right off the cuff cause we're  
Spontaneous.  
Let's hop a bus to shop, we'll check out Filene's, and  
Get chunky jewelry at Chico's.  
I'll buy you a panini, and some Spanks to make you teeny  
... You're the lady with the big brown eyes


[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 1]  
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying  
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?  
To keep you warm  
I showed you the game everybody else was playing  
That's for sure  
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying  
Oh lord  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 2]  
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken  
Yes I did  
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open  
Just admit it  
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping  
Can't deny it  
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping  
Tell me...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Couldn't find you anywhere  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I was by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
I need you the most

[Verse]  
Drizzy Drake, check me out  
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side  
Kick game, run game, run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?  
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell  
Certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess that they don't really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still, let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them  
I'm all day with it man, A. M to the P. M  
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
That's that ish that drives me crazy  
And that's all I've been getting lately  
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them  
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

It's a big big world  
It's easy to get lost in it  
You've always been my girl (ah)  
And I'm not ready to call it quits  
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight  
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies  
I know it's hard baby believe, me  
  
That we can go nowhere but up  
From here my dear  
Baby we can go nowhere but up  
Tell me what we got to fear  
We'll take you to the sky past the moon  
Through the galaxy  
As long as you're with me baby  
Honestly (honestly)  
With the strength of our love  
We can go nowhere but up  
  
It's a big, big world  
And girl, I'm gonna show you all of it  
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh  
From every ocean that we're swimming in  
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight  
We can make those gray clouds turn to blue skies  
Yeah I know it's hard baby believe me (oh)  
  
That we can go nowhere but up

Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda  
I clean up good, aropa, dopa  
Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor  
I'm a young star but my money look Yoda  
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit  
You hating on the internet, I couldn't even notice  
Tickets no service, we at the top working  
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"  
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby  
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres  
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important

You know me, I'm just tryna...

Look at all the choices  
The choices in this world  
World spreading no freedom  
Freedom for the boys and the girls  
  
But the boys and the girls  
They don't know  
What love is like  
Love is like appreciation  
Mixed in a double cup of sprite  
  
So can we go  
No left or right  
You go your way  
And I'll go mine  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Look at all the places  
Places that I've been  
It doesn't come easy  
You gotta have strength  
And when it goes down  
And it's all said and done  
  
You gotta stand up to them  
There's no need to run  
And now that I've made it  
I won't look back no  
Sacrifice what meant the most to me  
The most to me  
Yes I did  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Look at all the people standing outside  
So dedicated  
Your love doesn't go unrecognized  
Your love doesn't go unrecognized

They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.  
I, I see them coming, coming.  
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.  
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.  
  
Yeah, I think they mad 'cause I'm driving in the fast lane  
But I've been grindin' for years, ask hype game  
It's funny how stuff doesn't change  
From sleepin' in the car to coppin' me that Range  
I'm all world star  
All them other blogs  
All them haters hatin' cause I am a heart throb  
But do I want it all?  
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me  
I'm here to make history  
I'm speakin' it real  
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah  
So Imma show the world that I'm I'll  
Every beat that I get on best believe I'ma kill  
So you can have all the jewelry  
Have all the cars  
Have all the fame  
Have all the broads  
You can have the fact that I'm a star  
Just so you can listen to these bars

They don't walk the walk I walk.  
I won't stop, 'til I drop.  
Until then, I reach the top.  
Imma rock to where I need to be.  
  
Walk the path of destiny.  
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testin' me.  
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me. Objectively, I
need to tell you what just gets the best of me.  
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be.  
A lot of men ain't different though, just let it be.  
Set it free.  
Never be scared to make change, effectively.  
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively.  
Every person in this world can do good.  
I just want this message understood.  
Alright... Stop.  
Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no
division.  
Religion.  
Everybody needs a mission. Haters need to stop it, just listen.

What day is it? And in what month?  
This clock never seemed so alive  
I can't keep up and I can't back down  
I've been losing so much time  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right  
I'm tripping on words  
You've got my head spinning  
I don't know where to go from here  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
There's something about you now  
I can't quite figure out  
Everything she does is beautiful  
Everything she does is right  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
And me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you


You've got the mother load.  
You've got the stuff I like.  
Everytime I'm with you babe,  
I just get psyched.  
Like bling in your mouth but it's just old fillings.  
Dry skin on your hands, and your so cracked,  
Like (this part is mumbled in the video),  
Sittin on ur bed with your jacked up back.  
Hey girl, I want to watch you do you pilates, and skip  
The hard part.  
Cuz baby, you've got the mother load.
