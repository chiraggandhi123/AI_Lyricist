It's alright to cry even my dad does sometimes  
So don't wipe your eyes  
Tears remind you you're alive  
It's alright to die cause death the only thing you haven't tried  
But just for tonight hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
It's alright to shake  
Even my hand does sometimes  
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light  
It's alright to say that death's  
The only thing you haven't tried  
But just for today hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path and hold on


We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been  
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives  
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?  
I never know, no one wants it to  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
We're not friends, we could be anything  
If we tried to keep those secrets safe  
No one will find out if it all went wrong  
They'll never know what we've been through  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
But then again, if we're not friends  
Someone else might love you too  
And then again, if we're not friends  
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why  
  
Friends should sleep in other beds  
And friends should kiss me like you do  
And I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
Oh, my friends will never love me like you


Will you recognise me, in the flashing lights  
I try to keep my heart beat, but I can't get it right  
Will you recognise me, when I'm laying on my back  
Something's gone inside me, and it 'aint coming back, now  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah  
Then I'm gone (x7) woo woo woo wooo  
  
Will you recognise me, when I'm stealing from the poor  
You're not gonna' like me, no I'm nothing like before, wow  
And will you recognise me, when I lose another friend  
Will you learn to leave me, or give me one more try again  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, now  
Then I'm gone (x7) now woo woo woo wooo  
  
Baby be mine, now, mm, mm, mmm  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, wow  
Then I'm gone (x19)  
  
Baby be mine, oh, woah, wow


Could I wake up next to you when it's hitting double figures?  
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors  
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur  
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt  
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides  
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time  
Highbury Estate's fine, smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines  
  
Hey, I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my iPod  
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up, driver turn the lights  
Off  
Lights on, on stage, mics on, song plays, nice one  
Gotta keep my hype strong, truth be, never went to Uni  
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see  
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22,  
Done everything I need to, except get a 2:1  
  
I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
When I feel cold, you keep me warm  
And I'm not looking for some loose change  
Just wanna find a true mate  
Who wants to be my duvet, hey  
  
It's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah


[Verse 1]  
When the sins of my father  
Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down, lord  
Make it rain  
Oh, make it rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well, a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound  
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye  
But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The seas are full of water  
Stops by the shore  
It's like the riches of grandeur  
Never reach the poor  
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause  
And let lightning be the veins  
And fill the sky with all that they can draw  
When it's time to make a change  
  
[Chorus x4]


I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
Then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now


[Intro]  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Verse 1]  
Waking up, midnight November  
And just still in my bed  
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya  
There's things we've never said  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So if I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's not enough, to say I want ya  
Cause I'll say anything  
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt  
I had have just been questioning it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be  
  
[Bridge]  
All of my bones, they scream I'm right  
If you're taking me home to stay the night  
Darling my soul would heal  
  
[Outro]  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the wrong  
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, how long  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go


I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
(Hey-ey-ey yeah...)  
  
And I know dark clouds, will gather me  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me  
  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
Cause I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now


Treat me beneath this clear night sky  
And I will lie with you  
I start to feel those butterflies  
When I'm next to you  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
It's been this way since we were young  
We'll fight and then make up  
I'll breathe your air into my lungs  
When I feel your touch  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land


White lips, pale face  
Breathing in snowflakes  
Burnt lungs, sour taste  
  
Lights gone, days end  
Struggling to pay rent  
Long nights, strange men  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, for angels to fly  
  
Ripped gloves, raincoat  
Tried to swim and stay afloat  
Dry house, wet clothes  
  
Loose change, bank notes  
Weary-eyed, dry throat  
Call girl, no phone  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
But she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
Its too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
An angel will die  
Covered in white  
Closed eye  
And hoping for a better life  
This time, we'll fade out tonight  
Straight down the line  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
They scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
And we're under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And we don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in the pipe fly to the motherland  
Or sell love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, angels to fly  
To fly, fly  
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly  
Angels to die


Things were all good yesterday  
And then the devil took your memory  
And if you fell to your death today  
I hope that heaven is your resting place  
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain  
But then that could have been the medicine  
And now you're lying in the bed again  
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And things were all good yesterday  
Then the devil took your breath away  
And now we're left here in the pain  
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain  
And now my family is one again  
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend  
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen  
Six years old I remember when  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
And my mother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah  
And my brother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah


It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon  
I saw a shooting star and thought of you  
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  
If you were here, I'd sing to you  
You're on the other side, as this skyline splits in two  
Miles away from seeing you  
  
But I can see the stars from America  
I wondered do you see them too?  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
I can hear your heart on the radio beats  
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us  
Back to the time you were lying next to me  
I looked across and fell in love  
So I took your hand back through London streets and knew  
Everything led back to you  
  
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?  
Hear the song our heart is beating to?  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
And all  
And all  
And all  
I can see the stars from America


Another day another life  
Passes by just like mine  
It's not complicated  
  
Another mind  
Another soul  
Another body to grow old  
It's not complicated  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Another tear  
Another cry  
Another place for us to die  
It's not complicated  
  
Another love that's gone to waste  
Another light lost from your face  
It's complicated  
  
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Ooh how I miss you  
My symphony played the song that carried you out  
Ooh how I miss you  
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Touch down  
Like a seven four seven  
Or stay out and we'll live forever now


Unhappy days that left us on the floor  
And you breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure  
Everything will brighten up  
If we go to Brighton, I'll take you along the pier  
Everything will lighten up  
If you feel too frightened, I'll make it disappear, dear  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And sunny days that left my skin bright red  
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head  
If it gets too complicated,  
I'll keep up and be frustrated, can you see what's wrong?  
If you feel like you've been hated,  
This love's too overrated, see what's going on, on  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
Take me back to live at home  
And take me back to Albert Road  
  
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I can feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
I thought I'd put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I could feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
Now it seems you loved me too

I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain  
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008  
This music gave me a lane to ride in,  
But there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight  
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a of a lion  
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars  
You can't gamble with no cards  
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge  
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar  
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly  
But when I'm writing songs,  
I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies  
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind  
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies  
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog  
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong  
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be  
  
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on you. K. Streets  
When a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets  
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool  
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk  
Listen, we all get down in the dumps  
But when they hear the melody and base line pump  
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then  
I run loose on my tongue  
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one  
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my  
Cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation.


[Verse 1]  
I've been spinning now for time  
Couple women by my side  
I got sinning on my mind  
Sipping on red wine  
I've been sitting here for ages  
Ripping out the pages  
How'd I get so faded?  
How'd I get so faded?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been looking for a lover  
Thought I'd find her in a bottle  
God, make me another one  
I'll be feeling this tomorrow  
Lord forgive me for the things I've done  
I was never meant to hurt no one  
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Bridge x5]  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
  
[Outro x6]  
Tell me when it kicks in  
I saw scars upon her  
Tell me when it kicks in  
Broken hearted


Goodbye Norma Jean  
Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the 22nd row  
Who sees you as something as more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe


She's like cold coffee in the morning  
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke  
She'll make me shiver without warning  
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke  
  
And you can stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
I'll wake with coffee in the morning  
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea  
Outside the day is up and calling  
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep  
  
Stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
'Cause I love the way you wake me up  
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight


Ah lahmlahlah  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I met this girl late last year  
She said don't you worry if I disappear  
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake  
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
But then I jump right in  
A week later returned  
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
But I gave her my time for two or three nights  
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right  
I went away for months until our paths crossed again  
She told me I was never looking for a friend  
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10  
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin  
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am  
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said  
She's singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
For a couple weeks I  
Only want to see her  
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza  
Before a text message was the only way to reach her  
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her  
Singing out Aretha  
All over the track like a feature  
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either  
But me and her we make money the same way  
Four cities, two planes the same day  
Those shows have never been what it's about  
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch  
But we should get on a plane  
Or we'll be missing it now  
Wish I'd have written it down  
The way that things played out  
When she was kissing him  
How? I was confused about  
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 3:]  
[Knock knock] on my hotel door  
I don't even know if she knows what for  
She was crying on my shoulder  
I already told ya  
Trust and respect is what we do this for  
I never intended to be next  
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
And I never saw him as a threat  
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
It's not like we were both on tour  
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor  
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different  
This is not the way you realize what you wanted  
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest  
All this time God knows I'm singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus 2x:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah


I wanna be drunk when I wake up  
On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never in a excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me  
It never made me stronger at all.  
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  
So now I'll maybe leave back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.  
  
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beating  
'Cause you take part of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I've got no plans for the weekend  
So shall we speak then  
Keep it between friends  
No, I know you'll never love me like you used to.  
  
But may be other people like us  
Who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before  
You don't hold me anymore.  
  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake  
You know I can't change as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.  
  
All by myself  
I'm here again  
All by myself  
You know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself  
I'm just drunk, again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.


[Taylor Swift]  
I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
"Love at first sight" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that's when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could've happened to make you feel so low?  
Don't let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don't let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.  
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren't drinking then I'd be crying,  
And I think that's something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can't feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That's the thing about love,  
That's the reason why I'll never fall again,  
It hurts when it's supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that's what love is,  
Then I don't ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we've only met each other,  
We'll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.


Faces change  
But this place'll stay the same  
And I'll know  
When I'll go  
  
Yeah  
And I'm pickin' up another bag  
And I pack another knapsack  
The airport's like a stop light to me  
Sittin' on red, green light go  
Can't see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans, some may call 'em  
And it's on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream  
I lived the life, signed a picture  
'Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block, they judge you on 'em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?  
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
I'm the  
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write  
With a broken pen, there they go again  
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam  
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in  
I'm goin' home, I'm home again  
Bring it back up in the UK  
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy, hell, you say  
I'm just bein' blunt, homie  
Keep the grass  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah, take one look  
Better yet, take two  
But if I take that break, there's a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots I've been  
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season  
'Cause I am not the reason  
That the image you're used to seein'  
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes, I'm different  
Differently made  
And me screamin' the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
It's the place I stayed  
'Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught, but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne, it was in my name  
Michael  
M.W.A  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin' out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven  
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood line's not a family tree  
It's a needle in my skin for all to see  
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly


The rain won't stop falling,  
It's harder than before  
This car keeps on stalling,  
Pedal to the floor  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know is if you want me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We were young and we were foolish  
Schoolbooks in our arms  
Dodging homework, dodging classes  
To set off fire alarms  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call


I fell in love next to you  
Burning fires in this room  
It just fits, light and smooth  
Like my feet in my shoes  
Little one, lie with me  
Sew you heart to my sleeve  
We'll stay quiet underneath  
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
Teach my skin those new tricks  
Warm me up with your lips  
Heart to heart, melt me down  
It's too cold in this town  
Close your eyes, lean on me  
Face to mouth, lips to cheek  
Feeling numb in my feet  
You're the one  
To help me get to sleep  
  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes


Give me love like her,  
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,  
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,  
Told you I'd let them go,  
And that I'll fight my corner,  
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,  
After my blood turns into alcohol,  
No, I just wanna hold ya.  
  
Give a little time to me or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love.  
  
Give me love like never before,  
'Cause lately I've been craving more,  
And it's been a while but I still feel the same,  
Maybe I should let you go,  
You know I'll fight my corner,  
And that tonight I'll call ya,  
After my blood is drowning in alcohol,  
No I just wanna hold ya.  
  
Give a little time to me or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
Give a little time to me, or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My my, my, my, oh give me love.  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover.  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me).  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love, love me),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love).  
  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love  
  
Of all the money that e'er I had  
I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e'er I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of width  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
Of all the comrades that ever I had  
They are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that ever I had  
They would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all


Smoke alarm went off at night  
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye  
She left a note, I'll be back in five  
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive  
  
Hey!  
  
I was told to put my job in front of you,  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love,  
Waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge  
Smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved  
  
I never told her that I liked  
The way she dances slightly out of time  
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard  
But I tell her all the time  
  
Hey!  
  
Well I was told to put my job in front of you  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
But maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved, hey  
  
I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
But maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved


My mind is a warrior,  
My heart is a foreigner,  
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset,  
I'll never keep it bottled up,  
Left to the hands of the coroner,  
Be a true heart not a follower,  
We're not done yet now,  
I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we can ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
Now keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down.  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
My eyes are a river filler,  
This drink is a liver killer,  
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
  
And your mind is my new best friend,  
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again,  
Now I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we should ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
We'll keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down


Oh, misty eye of the mountain dewlow  
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls  
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke  
Keep watching over Durin's son  
  
If this is to end in fire  
Then we should all burn together  
Watch the flames climb high into the night  
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
And if we should die tonight  
Then we should all die together  
Raise a glass of wine for the last time  
Calling out father, oh  
Prepare as we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn over  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see fire  
Inside the mountain  
I see fire  
Burning the trees  
And I see fire  
Hollowing souls  
I see fire  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
Oh, should my people fall in  
Surely I'll do the same  
Confined in mountain halls  
We got too close to the flame  
Calling out father  
Hold fast and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
And if the babies are burning  
I will get myself a fork  
For if the dark returns then  
My brothers will come for dinner  
And as the sky is falling down  
It crashed into this party town  
And with that shadow upon the ground  
I hear my people screaming out  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
  
I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning) (fire)  
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)  
And I see fire (Uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)  
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side


Tempo sees Ed not feeling his best.  
  
Ooh I'm a mess right now  
Inside out  
Searching for a sweet surrender  
But this is not the end  
I can't work it out  
How going through the motions  
Going through us  
And oh I've known it for the longest time  
And all my hope  
All my words are all over written on the signs  
But you're on my road walking me home  
Home, home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
And put your faith in my stomach  
  
I messed up this time  
Late last night  
Drinking to suppress devotion  
With fingers intertwined  
I can't shake this feeling now  
We're going through the motions  
Hoping you'd stop  
  
And oh I've only caused you pain  
You know but all of my words will always below  
Of all the love you spoke  
When you're on my road walking me home  
Home, home, home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
Put your faith in my stomach  
  
And for how long I love my lover  
For how long I love my lover  
And now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover  
(I feel love)  
For how long, long I love my lover  
For how long, long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long, long I love my lover  
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long I love my lover  
Now now  
For how long, long I love my lover


Settle down with me  
Cover me up  
Cuddle me in  
  
Lie down with me  
And hold me in your arms  
  
And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed in my neck  
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet  
And I'm feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now  
  
Kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love  
Falling in love  
  
Settle down with me  
And I'll be your safety  
You'll be my lady  
  
I was made to keep your body warm  
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms  
  
Oh no  
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed in my neck  
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet  
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now  
  
Kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
I'm falling in love  
Falling in love  
  
Yeah I've been feeling everything  
From hate to love  
From love to lust  
From lust to truth  
I guess that's how I know you  
So I hold you close to help you give it up  
  
So kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love

You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love


I'm gonna pick up the pieces  
And build a Lego house  
When things go wrong we can knock it down  
  
My three words have two meanings  
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you  
  
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in  
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall  
  
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before  
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
Don't hold me down,  
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take  
  
And if it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now


You give me life like lots of oxygen  
You treat me like I was in love again  
And I'd hold you tight, tight enough to know  
That you were mine, I'd never let you go  
  
And it's you I miss  
And it's you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out, now  
And let it out  
And let it out now, now  
  
And you speak to me behind your dark green stare  
And you'd let me be as if I wasn't there  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex,  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue  
  
It's you I miss  
And it's you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out, now  
And let it out  
And let it out, now, now.  
  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn part, you see we were just like glue  
  
We're like glue  
  
So let it out  
Let it out, now  
Let it out  
And let it out, now, now  
  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


If we take this bird in, with it's broken leg,  
We can nurse it, she said,  
Come inside for a little lie down with me,  
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing.  
  
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,  
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?  
And let me hold you, oh.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,  
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,  
Come inside for a little home made tea,  
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,  
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,  
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now,  
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love,  
You make me scream, then I made you cry,  
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
You're my little bird.


There wasn't much left  
Except for the last twenty sack  
And the last twenty of my last check  
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step  
Woke up and took it in with a half breath  
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick  
I lit my cigarette  
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind  
Then came the dead  
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest  
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by  
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye  
Baby in her arms  
She took a cab home  
She told me I was only good for a sad song  
A crooked smile I gave  
Nonchalant about it  
Maybe she'll come back  
This time I doubt it  
Act like I care, but I really don't  
Wanted to change  
But somehow I knew I really won't  
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle  
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow  
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal  
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill  
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand  
God's not going to land another saving hand  
If the time came like it has time again  
Then I would watch the clock and be late again  
One gun and a Harley in the driveway  
One way out, dirt road, pathway  
Put another dead butt in the ash tray  
I stand up still drunk, half baked  
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring  
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring  
Paid him no attention  
In fact I barely seen him  
Until he walked away  
And he started singing  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I didn't see it coming  
I didn't see the wall  
And I went from running, to a slow crawl  
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry  
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie  
I speak no evil, but hear no angels  
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers  
Take the bible from the hotel drawer  
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door  
Knock knock  
I'm on the salt road non stop  
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot  
And the gust of a dry summer  
Dirty water in the tap  
I think I found my number in the sand  
Right next to an empty can  
Old number seven, Jack is back again  
And the voice goes round and round  
And I would take the bridge  
But I can't forget the sound  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
And we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down


Shock horror,  
I'm down,  
Lost your not around,  
There's a lump in my chest that,  
Sends cold through my head and,  
My mind shuts sound out,  
I'm on auto pilot,  
And my tongue's gone silent,  
  
Just switch it off and lay it down,  
Lay it down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
And I miss you,  
  
These words mean nothing to me,  
I'm just sitting on a fence of  
How it used to be,  
These three words,  
Are aching,  
Constrict them, Suffocating  
My mind is racing with the picture I'm painting,  
And my belly's sick to it's stomach,  
When I remember all the times he was with you when you,  
  
Layed it down,  
You lay down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
  
More than I let on,  
And I kissed you,  
For far too long,  
I'll let go,  
As soon as you do,  
But I know,  
That we're not through  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
That I miss you,  
(Woahhh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you.


If you were here beside me,  
Instead of in New York  
If the curve of you was curved on me  
  
I'd tell you that I loved you  
Before I even knew you  
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you  
  
If our hearts had never broken  
Well there's no joy in the mending  
So much this hurt can teach us both  
  
There's distance and there's silence  
Your words have never left me  
They're the prayer that I say every day  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the heat of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
If you were here beside me  
Instead of New York  
In the arms you said you'd never leave  
  
I'd tell you that it's simple  
And it was only ever thus  
There is nowhere else that I belong  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
Just give me a sign  
There is end in a beginning  
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to go out


[Verse:]  
Tell me that you turned down the man  
Who asked for your hand  
Cause you're waiting for me  
And I know, you're gonna be away a while  
But I've got no plans at all to leave  
And would you take away my hopes and dreams  
And just stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Take my hand and my  
Heart and soul, I will  
Only have these eyes for you  
And you know, everything changes but  
We'll be strangers if, we see this through  
You could stay within these walls and bleed  
Or just stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend  
Cause you are the only one  
  
[Bridge:]  
I'm stumbling out drunk, getting myself lost  
I am so gone, so tell me the way home  
I listen to sad songs, singing about love  
And where it goes wrong?  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend  
Cause you are the only one


If should glass kill  
The arms in could and lights  
From the bulletproof left  
  
We are the mirror and suicide  
Better plot to hand the glass  
Cellophane the mercy to arms  
  
Forward the shots leads to watch  
Kill controller the noise an lines  
Touch and burned the insides  
The breathless and lights in the dead  
  
Speaker of the dead in chicago rusted  
Awakening the rusted and roads  
Remove the crushing below the inside  
Fresh out ride and glass  
Inside the aim controller lines  
  
Closure behind the stage  
The chosen bitter the dedications  
Reds and the capitalist  
Close your ground is a broken glass


Of all the money that e'er I had  
I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e'er I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of wit  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
Of all the comrades that e'er I had  
They are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had  
They would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all


[Verse 1]  
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes.  
But it's the only thing that I know.  
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,  
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts are never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul,  
And it's the only thing that I know, know.  
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of 'ya,  
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts were never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone,  
And if you hurt me,  
That's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home.  
  
[Bridge]  
You can fit me  
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen.  
Next to your heartbeat where I should be.  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
And if you hurt me  
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
  
[Outro]  
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me  
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street,  
Hearing you whisper through the phone,  
Wait for me to come home.

I've known it for a long time  
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night  
Disappearing all night  
I don't wanna know where he's been lying  
I know what I wanna do  
I wanna runaway runaway with you  
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go  
How long are you leaving?  
Well dad just don't expect me back  
This evening  
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this  
It's been a long day almost out of the roadway  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in this home  
There's nothing to say cuz he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own  
  
I've never seen my dad cry  
Cold as stone, in the kitchen light  
I tell you it's about time  
But I was raised to keep quiet  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move  
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go  
  
How long are you leaving?  
Well dad just don't expect me back, this evening  
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this  
It's been a long day  
Almost out of the roadway  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in this home  
There's nothing to say cuz he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own  
  
Back pack, and a flat cap  
Turned to the back  
Cause I packed my clothes up  
My dad wasn't in without that plan to attack and turns his shoulder  
I don't wanna live this way  
Gonna take my things and go  
If things change in a matter of days  
Could be persuaded to hold up  
And mama was the same  
None of us are saints  
To get the god knows that  
I don't wanna runaway  
And one of these days I might just show that  
Put my home in a suitcase  
tie both shoelaces, and hope that  
Things change, but for now  
I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder  
  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in home  
There's nothing to say and he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own


I paid all my dues  
And she wanted to know  
That I'd never leave her  
Now I'm ready to go  
And strange as it seems  
She's endless to me  
She's just like paperwork  
But harder to read  
  
Patience, my enemy  
And loving's my friend  
It's harder to leave  
With my heart on my sleeve  
Than to stay and just pretend  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
  
I made all my plans  
And she has made hers  
She kept me in mind  
But I wasn't sure  
I searched every room  
For a way to escape  
But every time  
I tried to leave  
She keeps holding on to me  
For dear life  
And blocking my way  
  
Patience, my enemy  
And loving's my friend  
It's harder to leave  
With my heart on my sleeve  
Than to stay and just pretend  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
  
And like the back of her hand  
She already understands everything  
Won't you stay?  
She says  
And she already knows how it goes  
And where she stands  
I'll stay, anyway  
Cos she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


I can taste salt water  
And if I blink again  
You'll be sinking in  
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made  
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him  
And pretty soon you'll be floating away  
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat, love  
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
  
I still taste salt water  
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness  
And I'll drown within the oceans you made  
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up  
I'll never trust you again  
You can just be a friend  
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat, love  
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth  
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild  
Tonight, the fact is I  
I'm on my way home  
I'm on my way home  
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made  
  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes


It's late in the evening  
Glass on the side now  
I've been sat with you  
For most of the night  
Ignoring everybody here  
We wish they would disappear  
So maybe we could get down now  
And I don't wanna know  
If you're getting ahead of the program  
I want you to be mine, lady  
To hold your body close  
Take another step into the no-man's land  
For the longest time lady  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe  
  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
  
This love is a blaze  
I saw flames from the side of the stage  
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days  
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know  
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke  
Let it go until I wrote a change  
Singing we found love in a local rage no  
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say  
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray  
I told them my name and said it's nice to meet ya  
And then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila  
I already know she's a keeper  
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep  
If anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home  
But I'm drunk and gonna live it now not?  
We just sit on the couch one thing  
Led to another now she's kissing my mouth  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe  
  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
  
Can you feel it?  
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance  
Can you feel it?  
All that I can here is music from the back  
Can you feel it?  
Found you hiding here so hoped you taked my hand  
  
Before the beats kicks in again  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe


You're not her, though I try to see you differently  
I tow the line  
You see I'm searching for what used to be mine  
I saw your eyes  
And then I saw her staring back at me  
And I will try to find another one  
Who suited me as well as her  
  
I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
She was mine  
I was hers and all that's in between  
If she would cry,  
I would shelter her  
And keep her from the darkness that will be  
  
If I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never even talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might find  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might learn  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
We never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you.


This city never sleeps  
I hear the people walk by when it's late  
Sirens bleed through my windowsill  
I can't close my eyes  
Can't control what I'm into  
This tower is alive  
The lights that blind keep me awake  
With my hood up and lace untied  
Sleep fills my mind  
Can't control what I'm into  
  
London calls me a stranger  
A traveler  
This is now my home, my home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two  
  
The pavement is my friend  
And it will take me where I need to go  
I find it trips me up  
And puts me down  
This is not what I'm used to  
The shop across the road  
Fulfills my needs and gives me company  
When I need it  
Voices speak through my walls  
I don't think I'm gonna make it  
Past tomorrow  
  
London calls me a stranger  
A traveler  
This is now my home, my home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two  
  
And my lungs hurt  
And my ears bled  
With the sound of the city life  
Echoed in my head  
Do I need this to keep me alive?  
The traffic stops and starts  
But I need to move along  
  
London calls me a stranger  
This is not my home, home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two


I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things my mother
seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,  
Never been known by my government name, my foster home is where I've been
placed away from the pain,  
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with
nothing on me but power and glory,  
And surely you'll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was
made to disappear for me,  
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never
meant to I won't hold it against you,  
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in
my forearms,  
Forget me not never let me stop you'll just sit and watch it's your job to be
patient so you'll let me off,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side, see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,  
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away,  
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I
guess the teacher finds it hard to,  
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry
a head fuck,  
Constantly told I won't pass my gcse's,  
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese,  
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,  
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,  
Lately classmates think I'm crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey,  
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it without new clothes or
shower it hard to do,  
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes but they'll get
taken off me when I get back to the group home,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,  
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away.


[Verse 1]  
When your legs don't work like they used to before  
And I can't sweep you off of your feet  
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?  
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?  
And darling I will be loving you 'till we're 70  
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23  
And I'm thinking 'bout how  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe just a touch of a hand  
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day  
And I just wanna tell you I am  
  
[Chorus]  
So honey, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are  
  
[Verse 2]  
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades  
And the crowds don't remember my name  
When my hands don't play the strings the same way  
Mmm, I know you will still love me the same  
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen  
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory  
And I'm thinking about how  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe it's all part of a plan  
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes  
Hoping that you'll understand  
  
[Chorus]  
But baby, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are oh oh..  
  
La la la la la la....  
  
[Chorus]  
So baby, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Oh darling  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
That maybe we found love right where we are  
And baby we found love right where we are  
And we found love right where we are


This is the start of something beautiful  
This is the start of something new  
You are the one who'd make me lose it all  
You are the start of something new, ooh  
  
And I'll throw it all away  
And watch you fall into my arms again  
And I'll throw it all away  
Watch you fall, now  
  
You are the earth that I will stand upon  
You are the words that I will sing  
  
And I've thrown it all away  
And watched you fall into his arms again  
And I thrown it all away  
Watched you fall, now  
  
And take me back  
Take me home  
Watch me fall  
Down to earth  
Take me back for  
  
This is the start of something beautiful  
You are the start of something new


I found your hairband on my bedroom floor  
The only evidence that you've been here before  
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore  
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes  
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light
on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night  
I don't drink like everybody else  
End up forgetting things about myself  
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked  
My head's still with you but my hearts just not  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that  
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views  
Everything's great but everything's short  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now I'm in position to be another stalker  
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward  
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous  
On the surface  
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now  
And maybe I can let myself down oh  
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground  
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low  
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms  
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong  
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one  
But I know that god made another one of me  
To love you better than I ever will  
  
'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied


These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid  
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits  
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it  
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?  
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones  
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones  
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum  
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots  
  
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love  
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love  
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above  
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up  
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan  
No one here to save the day now you're all alone  
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth  
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone  
  
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again  
I never close my eyes,  
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you  
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)  
  
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile  
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind  
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan  
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan  
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one  
I know your proud staring at your grandson  
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I  
like  
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write  
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine  
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die  
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'  
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry  
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must  
now I gotta fly  
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,  
I don't stop at night.  
  
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again  
I never close my eyes,  
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
