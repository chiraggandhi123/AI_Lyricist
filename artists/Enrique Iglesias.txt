When I'm with you a chain reaction  
Like a rush of satisfaction  
Suddenly coming over me  
  
Your eyes telling me that you hold the key  
The key to unlock my fantasies  
Baby this is where I want to be  
  
My heart is beating so hard it's frightening  
Feels like I'm hit by lightening  
Every time I watch you move  
  
You're so in tune with your body  
And I can see that no one else will do  
Cause I'm so into you  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, just can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore  
  
You can take care of my affliction  
Satisfy my addiction  
You know what you have to do  
When your body wants my affliction  
You take me in a new direction  
One where there's only you and me  
  
And then we reise to the moment  
And I can feel your love all around me  
Now it's time to give it all  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, just can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore  
  
Just one look in your eyes and  
I'm in heaven  
There's so much that  
I want I go insane  
Take me here, make me yours now and forever  
I can take all the pleasure and the pain  
  
Alabao, you got the touch  
Alabao, you got the motion  
Alabao, I can't hold back any more  
Alabao, you lift me up  
Alabao, you knock me down  
Alabao, you're the one that I adore

Come on!  
It is you and me...  
  
I see you standin' there  
And I'm watchin' every move you make  
I'm just waiting for the moment to... walk up to you... and tell the truth  
You will understand  
Something about you makes me lose control  
Takes my thoughts into another world  
Where you touchin' me and you can't let go...  
  
I see you standin'  
Across a floor  
I'm comin' to ya... to ya... to ya...

Ohh... Love's right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
Sometimes I try to find  
A million reasons not to be with you  
Now you are way deep inside of me  
And it makes me weak  
Ohh I just can't breathe  
  
I see you dancin'  
On the floor  
I'm comin to you... to you... to you...  
  
Baby I... I'm gonna make you feel alive  
Ohh... I'm standin' right in front of you... all you have to do

It used to be, you and me  
Love like no other  
Our world around, could fall apart  
But we had each other  
Saw you walking, you were smiling  
And it hit me like the first time  
Feels like yesterday, has come and gone  
But nothing's changed, when I look at you  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
Still hurts sometimes  
Love on the line  
But we said forever  
Say it all, through the storms  
But we had together  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful


Driving through the night,  
Tears are running down my face,  
I start to realize, all the things that I once said,  
I promised you the world  
It's nothing more than you deserve  
It's killing me inside, to know I put you through this hell,  
  
Take away my heart,  
It doesn't want to work no more  
I never meant to make you cry,  
  
[Chorus]  
California calling 20 miles to go,  
And I don't, I don't know,  
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?  
No I don't, I don' t know  
I don't know,  
No I don't know  
  
I'm on the road and it feels so cold outside,  
It's driving me insane, to know how much you hurt tonight,  
Take away my heart, it doesn't want to work no more,  
I never meant to make you cry  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
California calling 20 miles to go,  
And I don't, I don't know,  
Shod I turn around or shod I leave you alone?  
No I don't, I don' t know  
I don't know,  
No I don't know  
  
Gotta keep on moving on [Repeat: x3]  
California calling, California calling,  
Gotta keep on moving on [Repeat: x3]  
California calling, California calling,


I am numb but I can still feel you  
Sometimes I'm blind but I see you  
You are here but so far away  
  
The times when you wanna, I'm missing you  
Makes me feel like I'm spinning  
Sometimes you get what you gain  
  
I'm on a coaster-collision  
Am not about to give in  
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in.  
  
Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings  
No intermission, so let  
Let the party begin.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
  
Can you hear me? can you hear me? can you hear me? can you hear me?  
  
Don't you mean that you're my vision  
I gotta make a decision  
Do I go, do I stay? (stay)  
  
You've gotten into my system  
You are in control of my mental  
I'm in a euphoric state  
  
I'm on a coaster-collision  
Am not about to give in  
Can't explain my position or the condition that I'm in.  
  
Where I am is no limit, no walls, no ceilings  
No intermission, so let  
Let the party begin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you hear me? [Repeats]  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey all the way  
DJ let it play.  
Hey hey can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Enrique, yea I can  
This is Mr Morales

And you tell everyone  
That I can't live without you  
Even for one day  
But who gave you the right  
To talk about the way

Don't laugh behind my back  
'Cause what goes around  
I promise you comes back  
Now I realize  
You were never mine  
We were never right  
Baby you will find

We're strong, we're weak, we're tired  
We're straight, we're gay, we're bi  
We're black, we're white - why  
To tell the truth, we lie  
We get so trapped inside our little lives  
They disappear, before our very eyes  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight  
  
We won, we lost, we tried  
Be a saint, I'm fine 'cause I died  
I'm so sick and tired of crying  
So tonight, it's time, just fly  
So now we got so close  
Caught up in the deal  
  
The only thing we had is real  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on  
It's time we gave it up tonight  
Live it up tonight  
  
So we can keep it, make it real

To say goodbye  
I know my love for you  
Is still alive  
  
So come on live it up tonight  
Live it up tonight, move on

Wetter than an ocean wave

Five is the time you kidnap my mind  
Into ecstasy  
  
I'm lost inside your love  
Believe me  
And if I don't come up  
Then leave me  
Inside your love forever

She called me up late at night  
We called an innocent crime  
She's such a good waste of time  
But in the back of my mind  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
  
[Jennifer Lopez]  
Kills me to let it inside  
Feels like the wrong kind of guy  
He falls asleep by my side  
But in the back of my mind  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Lay me down, mouth to mouth  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Lay me down, mouth to mouth


Let me tell you  
  
Jenny's getting dressed up  
In my room  
Puts on her skirt and  
She's looking good  
Six am and she's leaving soon  
Says  
"What a crazy night  
I had a real good time"  
But her kiss tells me  
It's goodbye  
Just like nothing  
Happened last night  
But if I had one chance  
I'd do it all over again  
  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
For a night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
No no  
  
Now I'm left up  
In my lonely room  
She left her underwear  
And her perfume  
I never thought  
It could be this good  
And I still feel her lips  
Up on my fingertips  
I'm trying hard  
Not to feel rejected  
Maybe the phone line's disconnected  
But if I had one chance  
I'd do it all over again  
  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
For a night stand  
I don't think she's coming  
Back for more  
She was only looking  
In night stand  
But I'd do it  
All over again for sure  
  
Baby like a blind man  
I rushed in now  
Do I have the right to ask  
"Will you be coming back again?"  
  
(One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back  
One night stand  
I don't think she's coming back)  
  
One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more  
She was only looking  
One night stand I don't think she's coming back for more  
She was only looking for a one night stand I don't think she's coming back for
more  
She was only looking for a one night stand I don't think she's coming back for
more  
She was only looking  
One night stand but I'd do it all again for sure  
  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I guess it was a one night stand  
One night stand  
I know it, yeah


Tres de la manana  
y no me puedo dormir.  
Ojala te tuviera aqui junto a mi.  
Una voz por dentro  
me dice "ten cuidado,  
esta chica es peligrosa  
cuando esta a tu lado, si".  
  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir.  
  
No se si es tu sonrisa,  
no se si es tu mirada,  
o lo que tu me haces  
cuando las luces se apagan.  
  
Tres de la manana  
y no me puedo dormir.  
Ojala supiera que pretendes de mi.  
  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir.  
  
Una voz por dentro  
me dice "ten cuidado,  
esta chica es peligrosa  
cuando esta a tu lado, si".  
  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir.  
  
Hey you, can't you see?  
She's playing with your heart.  
She's playing with your heart.  
Hey you can't you see?  
She's playing with your heart.  
She's playing with your heart.  
  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir.  
  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon.  
Para de jugar con mi corazon,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir,  
porque yo ya no quiero sufrir.  


I need you  
(oh yeah)  
I need you  
(oh yeah)  
I need you  
(oh yeah)  
How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking Every breath with you.  
Standin' all alone on the bedroom floor.  
Thinkin' about it more n more  
  
Chorus- where are you staying  
Are you in the world  
i'll do anything  
for you to be my girl.  
  
Yeah where has is taken me  
Drivin' me mad  
how are you copin' without your man.  
  
Chorus (x3)


Se te ne vai  
Il mio cuore annegher?  
Mare di guai  
che nessuno asciugher?  
  
Se te ne vai  
Il futuro mio lo so  
"Non mangio mai  
E non dormo neanche un po"  
  
Se te ne vai  
Vendo tutto e scappo via  
Che senso avrei?  
Senza la ragazza mia  
  
Le lacrime vengono gi?  
Se non le raccoglierai  
Non le troveremo pi?  
Muoio un po'  
Immaginando che farai?  
In che mondo viaggerai?  
Che canzone canterai?  
Se te ne vai  
  
Se te ne vai  
Quando hai tempo pensa che  
Comunque sei  
Aria limpida per me  
Sei la marea  
  
Che le spiagge porta via  
Sei un'idea  
La piu dolce che ci sia  
  
Le lacrime vengono gi?  
Se non le raccoglierai  
Non le troveremo pi?  
Muoio un po'  
Immaginando che farai?  
In che mondo viaggerai?  
Che canzone canterai?  
Se te ne vai


You, do you remember me?  
Like, I remember you  
Do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time?  
'Cause I, I walk the streets alone  
I hate being on my own  
And everyone can see that, I really fell  
And I'm going through hell  
Thinking about you with somebody else  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody wants you, somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single night  
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely  
Somebody hopes that one day you will see  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me  
Yeah  
  
How, how did we go wrong?  
It was so good, and now it's gone  
And I pray at night, that our passing will cross  
What we hide isn't lost  
'Cause you are always right here in my thoughts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You will always be in my life, even if I'm not in your life  
'Cause you're in my memory  
You, will you remember me?  
And before you set me free, oh listen please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me


You ask me if I love you, and I choke on my reply,  
I'd rather hurt you honestly, then mislead you with a lie  
and who am I to judge you, on what you say or do  
I'm only just beginning to see the real you  
  
Chours:  
Sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much  
and I have to close my eyes and hide,  
I wanna hold you till I die, till we both break down and cry  
I wanna hold you until the fear in me subsides  
  
Romance and all its' strategies, leaves me battling with my pride  
but through the insecurity some tenderness survives  
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truth  
a hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth  
  
Chours  
  
At times I'd like to break you, and drive your knees  
At times I'd like to break through, and hold you endlessly  
  
Chours


I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
Baby  
Yeah I might be a little faded  
And you might just think that I'm just hating  
But it seem to me that you downgraded  
I'm just saying  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
Lately  
I been thinkin about how we got crazy  
I hate to be the one to say this  
But I think your boyfriends overrated  
I'm just saying  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
I'm on one  
Been drinking  
Wanna show you what I been thinking  
Maybe we should get to leaving  
Cause that bed is still my kingdom  
And that body's my castle  
Hate to be the one top be the asshole  
But your boyfriend need to go home  
Cause the king's back  
Give me my throne  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king


C21 lyrics  
  
Stuck In My Heart  
  
Can't you tell  
You've been all over me like a spell - I know  
(I never wanna let you go)  
  
Can't you see  
You've been changing the world around me - I know  
(I never wanna let you go)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
Can't deny  
Since I met you that day I've been blind - to see  
(Now I wanna know for real)  
  
Inside me  
I'm afraid to wake up from a dream - and see  
(It never really happent to me)  
  
If you hold me close enough  
I can whisper you the words  
If the distance is to far  
I can't do nothing, cuz  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are  
  
You are...... Like a dream so deep inside of me  
  
You are...... The reason that I never sleep  
  
You are...... Stuck in my heart  
  
You are  
  
Can't you tell  
You've been all over me like a spell  
(I will never let you go, I will never let you go no, no)  
  
Can't you see  
You've been changing the world around me  
(I don't wanna let you go, no I'll never let you go no, no)  
  
You are stuck in my heart  
And we can go anywhere  
Whatever the reason you are  
So stuck in my heart  
Like counting a million stars  
For that many reasons you are


Go ahead just leave, can't hold you, you're free  
You take all these things, if they mean so much to you  
I gave you your dreams, 'cause you meant the world  
So did I deserve to be left here hurt  
You think I don't know you're out of control  
I ended up finding all of this from my boys  
Girl, you're stone cold, you say it ain't so,  
You already know I'm not attached to material  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love  
My love..  
  
Yeah  
What did I do but give love to you  
I'm just confused as I stand here and look at you  
From head to feet, all that's not me  
Go 'head, keep the keys, that's not what I need from you  
You think that you know (I do), you've made yourself cold (Oh yeah)  
How could you believe them over me, I'm your girl  
You're out of control (So what?), how could you let go (Oh yeah)  
Don't you know I'm not attached to material  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love  
  
So all this love I give you, take it away, (Unh, uh huh)  
  
You think material's the reason I came, (Unh, uh huh)  
  
If I had nothing would you want me to stay (Unh, uh huh)  
  
You keep your money, take it all away  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love  
  
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love  
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love  
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love  
  
Oh, my love  
Oh, my love


She came from nowhere and she stole my soul  
Her love was criminal  
I finally found what I was looking for  
Now I can't let it go  
  
We break up, to make up  
Yeah you got me spinning like a yo yo yo  
But I know that you know, yeah  
That girl you will always be mine  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back to me  
  
I get so high when she go down down low  
She work it nice and slow  
  
We going round and round and back and forth  
Can't take it anymore  
  
We break up, to make up  
You got me spinning like a yo yo yo  
  
But I know that you know  
That girl you will always be mine  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me  
  
There goes my baby  
My wholesome lady  
Hold me down if my whole world went crazy  
That' s what she spoke  
Just what she said  
Now that's a joke  
That talk is dead  
Know I got to get over the love I had  
The door I keep it open just in case she come back  
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad  
And I know my hearts broken but I've got so attached  
Baby come back I won't get no sleep  
She more than I want and all that I need  
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so  
And when my baby come back I'm crossing my T's dotting my I's  
And now I can't eat  
Out of my mind  
And that's how it's gonna be so, so  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me  
  
Hey!  
  
There goes my baby  
Whoa  
Hey hey baby come back to me, back, back to me


So Turn Up the Night  
I know you want it, oh yeah you want it  
Tonight is going down, and you with it  
Come on and take me higher  
You can be my firestarter  
Come and lay me down  
It'll only take a minutes  
Starting my ignition  
Yeah  
It's gonna burn when you're touchin 'me  
You cross this line  
Do you find it hard to say it with me  
Tonight?  
These've walked miles but I've walked in  
Straight line  
You'll never know what was there to be


You know I got this feeling that I just can't hide  
I try to tell you how I feel  
I try to tell you but I'm me  
Words don't come easily  
When you get close I share them  
  
I watch you when you smile  
I watch you when you cry  
And I still don't understand  
I can't find the way to tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish I was your lover  
I wish that you were mine  
Baby I got this feeling  
That I just can't hide  
  
Don't try to run away  
There's many things I wanna say  
No matter how it ends  
Just hold me when I tell you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Oh I need is a miracle  
Oh baby all I need is you  
All I need is a love you give  
Oh baby all I need is you  
Baby you  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Just wanna be your lover  
Just wanna be the one  
Let me be the lover  
Let me be the one  
Yeah yeah


Have I told you how good  
It feels to be me  
When I'm in you  
I can only stay clean  
When you are around  
Don't let me fall  
  
If I close my eyes for ever  
Would it ease the pain  
Could I breath again  
  
Baby I'm addicted and out of control  
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying  
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
I'm wasting away  
Made a million mistakes  
Am I to late  
There's a storm in my head  
And it rains on my bed  
When you're not here  
I'm not afraid of dying  
But I'm afraid of losing you  
  
Baby I'm addicted and out of control  
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying  
Baby I'm a lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
When you're lying next to me  
Love is going through to me  
O it's beautiful  
  
Everything is clear to me  
Till I hit reality  
I lose it all  
I lose it all  
I lose it all  
  
Baby I'm addicted  
And trying ,trying ,trying  
Baby I'm addicted  
Don't want to lose it all  
Baby I'm all lair but all I really know  
Is you're the only reason I'm trying  
  
Baby I'm addicted  
Baby I'm addicted  
Baby I'm addicted


She bought a ticket to nowhere  
And she told me that she's sick of this life  
She said don't worry, it's alright  
Cos she doesn't want to see me cry  
  
Oh, I wish that she could see  
How beautiful she is to me  
  
Baby, baby hold on  
Oh please don't let go  
Baby, baby be strong  
So much you don't know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know it's not easy  
But baby, baby hold on  
  
I wiped the tears from her face  
She's forgotten how her smile used to feel  
She holds my hand and she whispers  
Tell me why you love a loser like me  
  
Oh, I wish that she could see  
How beautiful she is to me  
  
Baby, baby hold on  
Oh please don't let go  
Baby, baby be strong  
So much you don't know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know it's not easy  
But baby, baby hold on  
  
Baby, baby hold on  
Oh baby hold on  
Oh baby, baby hold on  
  
I wish that you could see  
Oh how beautiful you are to me  
  
Oh baby, baby hold on  
Oh please don't let go  
Baby, baby be strong  
So much you don't know  
Life is crazy sometimes  
I know it's not easy  
I know it's not easy  
But baby, baby hold on  
  
Baby, baby hold on  
Baby, baby hold on


I've been down  
I've been beat  
I've been so that I could not speak  
I've been so lost that I could not see  
I wanted things that were out of reach  
Then I found you and help me through and you show me  
What to do  
That's why I'm comin' back to you  
  
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean  
That's how your love can take me home back to you  
And if I wish upon that star that someday i'll be where you are  
Cause I know that day is comin' soon yeah I'm comin' back to you  
  
You've been alone but you did not show it  
You've been in pain when I did not know it  
You let me do what I needed to  
You where there when I needed you  
  
Mighta let you down  
Mighta messed you round  
But you never change you point of view  
That's why I'm comin back to you.........


Well I am what I am could be what you are.  
Is your pain when you smile 'cause you feel alone?  
And are you strong enough to be yourself??  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser  
And you're never gonna have what it takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
If you cried, would you hide  
Would you want all the world to know  
And if you believe in love  
Would you let it show  
Are you in, are you hip, are you cool  
Do you try too hard  
Or are you strong enough to be yourself  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser  
And you're never gonna have what it takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser and you're never gonna have what it
takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
If you can't, can't be yourself you're gonna lose it all.  
If you can't,can't be yourself what are you living for?  
You're gonna find someday you gotta run away.  
You gotta run, run, run away.


Ow!  
Ha ha ha ha ah  
Anything you want,  
But never find the heart to leave me,  
'Cause I need you too much  
So play your game but don't desert me,  
Maybe you heard I'm tough  
To love but baby please believe me  
Don't be afraid to trust me,  
I wouldn't trade you for the world,  
And if you feel you gotta test me,  
Before you be my girl  
  
You can shake me, you can break me,  
But you can't make me,  
'Cause that the only this I won't,  
Do for you  
  
Sometimes I say too much  
I am right now so please forgive me  
But I can't help but touch  
The place I keep inside you in me  
I threw away my crutch,  
I'm man enough for you, can't you see me?  
  
Don't be afraid to try me,  
Come on and give a guy a whirl,  
And if you feel you gotta test me,  
Before you be my girl  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me  
'Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
Well I was making love inside my mind,  
Somebody take me to the other side,  
I wanna kiss so deep inside your world,  
So don't run away girl  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me,  
Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me,  
Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
  
I'd sail a thousand ships to finally kiss your lips


Over and over I look in your eyes  
You are all I desire  
You have captured me  
I want to hold you I want to be close to you  
I never want to let go  
I wish that this night would never end  
I need to know  
  
Could I hold you for a lifetime  
Could I look into your eyes  
Could I have this night to share this night together  
Could I hold you close beside me  
Could I hold you for all time  
Could I could I have this kiss forever  
Could I could I have this kiss forever, forever  
  
Over and over I've dreamed of this night  
Now you're here by my side  
You are next to me  
I want to hold you and touch you and taste you  
And make you want no one but me  
I wish that this kiss could never end  
Oh baby please  
  
Could I hold you for a lifetime  
Could I look into your eyes  
Could I have this night to share this night together  
Could I hold you close beside me  
Could I hold you for all time  
Could I could I have this kiss forever  
Could I could I have this kiss forever, forever  
  
I don't want any night to go by  
Without you by my side  
I just want all my days  
Spent being next to you  
Lived for just loving you  
And baby, oh by the way  
  
Could I hold you for a lifetime  
Could I look into your eyes  
Could I have this night to share this night together  
Could I hold you close beside me  
Could I hold you for all time  
Could I could I have this kiss forever  
Could I could I have this kiss forever, forever

Do you know  
  
Do you know?  
Do you know?  
  
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you
away?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door
has changed?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
  
If birds flying south is a sign of changes  
At least you can predict this every year  
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly  
I can't get it to speak  
Maybe if I knew all the things it took to save us  
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me  
Look in your eyes to see something about me  
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give.  
  
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you
away?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door
has changed?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
If you just don't talk to me, babe.  
  
I flow through my act  
There's a question: Is she needed?  
And decide all the man I can ever be.  
Looking at the last 3 years like I did  
I could never see us ending like this.  
  
(Do you know?)  
  
Seeing your face no more on my pillow  
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me.  
  
(Do you know?)  
  
But after this episode I don't see  
You could never tell the next thing life could be  
  
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you
away?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door
has changed?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
  
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you
away?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?

has changed?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
  
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you
away?  
(Do you know how it feels?)  
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door
has changed?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  
(Do you know how it feels?)  
  
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do ya?)  
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do ya?)


Do you know?  
And do you know?  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you know what it feels like  
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?  
(Do you know, do you know, do you know?)  
Do you know what it feels like  
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?  
(Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya)  
  
If birds flying south is a sign of changes  
At least you can predict this every year

[Chorus]  
  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
If you just don't talk to me, babe  
  
It flows through my head  
The question is she needed  
And decide all the man I can ever be.  
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,  
I could never see us ending like this (Do you know?)  
Seeing your face no more on my pillow

Do you know?  
Do you know?  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do ya


I don't have to tell you  
What this is all about  
'Cause baby half the fun  
Is in us figuring it all out  
  
So why you gotta ask me  
What I'm doing now  
'Cause I don't like to question  
What I still haven't found  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
So tell me how  
We're gonna get there  
It's hard to even try  
But if we move together  
We'll end up on the same side  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
If you could know  
What I'm feeling  
Would you run and  
Where would you go  
If you want to know  
What I'm thinking  
Then just turn on the lights  
And you'll know  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
(Don't turn off the lights)


They say love is just a game  
They say time can heal the pain  
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose  
And I guess I'm just a fool  
I keep holding on to you  
  
I told you once you were the one  
You know that I die for you  
Oh, though it hurts to see you go  
Oh, this time you should know  
I won't try to stop you  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
So you try to fake a smile  
You don't wanna break my heart  
I can see that you're afraid  
But baby it's to late  
'Cause I'm already dying  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you go  
  
Wherever I go  
I won't forget about you  
Oh no, no, no  
Wherever you go  
Don't you forget about me


You can run you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
You can run you can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
Here's how it goes  
You and me  
Up and down  
But maybe this time  
We'll get it right  
Worth the fight  
Cause love isn't something you can shake  
  
When it breaks all it takes is some trying  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
So if you go  
You should know  
It's hard to just forget the past  
So fast  
  
It was good  
It was bad,  
But it was real  
And that's all you have  
In the end our love mattered  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
Here's how it goes  
All it takes is some trying  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love  
  
You can run  
You can hide  
But you can't escape my love


Qualcosa di te sembra restare qui  
In questa notte che scende fredda e sola  
Un,aria di estasi che mi consola  
Mi avvolge come un abbraccio e m,innamora  
  
Ogni volta que ti vendo  
Io riscopro l,infinito  
Trema il cielo  
La notte vola via  
E il silenzio diventa melodia  
  
E,come un,esperienza religiosa  
Semtrot in ogni istante, in ogni cosa  
In questa notte buia  
Gi? sale un alleluia  
? un,esperienza religiosa  
  
Torna presto da me, non mi lasciare qui  
Che in questa notte profonda sto soffrendo  
Ho bisogno di vivere la tua allegria  
Per non sentire il dolore che porto dentro  
  
Nelle cose che mi hai dato  
Io mi sono ritrovato  
Il tempo pasa  
Veloce nel mio cuore  
Mi sento nuovo  
In questo grande amore  
  
E,come un,esperienza religiosa  
Sentire la tua mano che mi sfiora  
Toccare la tua pelle  
Tra mille e mille stelle  
? un,esperienza religiosa  
  
E,come un,esperienza religiosa  
Sentirti in ogni istante, in ogni cosa  
In questa notte buia  
Gi? sale un alleluia  
? un,esperienza religiosa

Y te pido PERDON


I want to know when you're gonna come.  
I want to jump when you want to jump.  
I want to touch where it makes you mine.  
I want to push til I get it right.  
  
'Cause I'm free, free to do the dirty things you like.  
I'm free, free to enough to do what's on my mind.  
When you go down and freak on me.  
That's when I'm free. That's when I'm free.  
  
I want to fall so you can pick me up.  
I want to scream until it hurts.  
But when you think that I can't come up.  
I'm gonna lay you down and show you what's right.  
  
'Cause I'm free, free to do the dirty things you like.  
I'm free, free to enough to do what's on my mind.  
When you go down and freak on me.  
That's when I'm free. That's when I'm free.  
  
I know what you're thinking that you can't deny.  
Don't act like you don't want it, come on you can't lie.  
Let me read your mind so I can come inside.  
So you say you want it, say you want it one more time.  
'cause I'm free...


I won't let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
It's the one good thing that I've got  
I won't let you down  
So please don't give me up  
Because I would really, really love to stick around  
  
Heaven knows I was just a young boy  
Didn't know what I wanted to be  
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy  
And I guess it was enough for me  
To win the race? A prettier face!  
Brand new clothes and a big fat place  
On your rock and roll TV  
But today the way I play the game is not the sameNo way  
Think I'm gonna get me some happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I told you so  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone else I've got to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Take back your singing in the rain  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy  
What a kick just a buddy and me  
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy  
We were living in a fantasy  
We won the race  
Got out of the place  
I went back home got a brand new face  
For the boys on MTV  
But today the way I play the game has got to change  
Oh yeah  
Now I'm gonna get myself happy  
  
I think there's something you should know  
I think it's time I stopped the show  
There's something deep inside of me  
There's someone I forgot to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Don't think that I'll be back again  
I just hope you understandSometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I don't belong to you  
And you don't belong to me  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
You've gotta give for what you take  
  
Well it looks like the road to heaven  
But it feels like the road to hell  
When I knew which side my bread was buttered  
I took the knife as well  
Posing for another picture  
Everybody's got to sell  
But when you shake your ass  
They notice fast  
And some mistakes were built to last  
  
That's what you get  
  
I say that's what you get  
  
That's what you get for changing your mind  
  
And after all this time  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes  
Do not make the man  
  
I'll hold on to my freedom  
May not be what you want from me  
Just the way it's got to be  
Lose the face nowI've got to live


Loving you was easy  
Thought you'd never leave me yeah, yeah  
Wrapped around my finger

Would you dance if I asked you to dance?  
Or would you run and never look back?  
Would you cry if you saw me crying?  
And would you save my soul tonight?  
Would you tremble if I touched your lips?  
Or would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this.  
Now would you die for the one you love?  
Oh hold me in your arms tonight.  
  
I can be your hero baby  
I can kiss away the pain  
I will stand by you forever  
You can take my breath away  
  
Would you swear that you'll always be mine  
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?  
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?  
I don't care. You're here tonight  
  
I can be your hero baby  
I can kiss away the pain  
I will stand by you forever  
You can take my breath away


Since the beginning of time  
Since it started to rain  
Since I heard you laugh  
Since I felt your pain  
I was too young, you were much younger  
We were afraid of each other's hunger  
  
I have always loved you  
There's never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby, I have always loved you  
  
Since we kissed the first time  
Since we slept on the beach  
You were too close for comfort  
You were too far out of reach  
You walked away, I should have held you  
Would you have stayed for me to tell you?  
  
I have always loved you  
There's never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby, I have always loved you  
Years go by in a matter of days  
And though we go separate ways  
I never stop dreaming of you  
I have always loved you  
  
When you call it makes me cry  
We never made time for you and I  
If I could live it all again  
I'd never let it end, I'd still be with you  
Oh God, I miss you  
  
I have always loved you  
There's never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby, I have always loved you  
Years go by in a matter of days  
And though we go separate ways  
I never stop dreaming of you  
I have always loved you


It's my time, It's my life, I can do what I like  
For the price of a smile,  
I got a ticket to ride,  
So I keep living, 'cause it feels right  
And it's so nice,  
And I'd do it all again  
This time, it's forever  
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels  
  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels,

Show me love, make us one,  
Let's make a beautiful world  
Take my hand, it's alright  
'Cause tonight we can fly  
  
So we keep living, 'cause it feels right  
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again  
This time, it's forever  
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels  
  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels,

Give me more, more, more  
'Cause I like how it feels  
Oh yeah, I like how it feels  
You know I like how it feels  
Oh yeah I like how it feels  
  
What you consider the best, I consider mediocre,  
I want my bank account like Carlos slim's, or at least mini Oprah  
Baby just close your eyes and imagine any part in the world, I've been there  
I'm like global warming, anything I just start to heat the things up, but I've
been here  
Time traveler, two time zones, give me some of my vodka any zone,  
Enrique Iglesias, and translation, Enrique Churches, confession

There is something I gotta tell you  
It goes like this  
  
Do you know you control  
Every single breath I take  
You can see through my soul,  
I feel it in the love we make  
  
And I try to find a place  
Where I can hide (yeah)  
But every time I try to fight  
The feeling it takes over me(yeah)  
  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
Yeah, it must be love  
  
When we talk you can read  
Every word inside my head  
Like you know what I need,  
And I can't imagine anywhere  
I d wanna be then right here with you baby,  
Next to me  
Why can't you see I try to fight  
The feeling, but I do believe(yeah)  
  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
It must be love  
  
It must be love (3x)  
  
I try to find a place  
Where I can hide(yeah)  
But everytime I try to fight  
The feeling it takes over me(Oouh)  
It must be love baby  
Coz it's killing me looking in your eyes  
It must be love coz  
Everytime you walk away I just fall apart  
  
And I don't know what it is,  
But I feel I'm in too deep  
No, I don't know what it is,  
It must be love  
It must be love  
It must be love


So you think  
You got it all worked out  
And what you're searching for  
Isn't what you found  
  
Up in this world  
That's on the run  
A lot of hits but only  
A few number ones  
I'm making love for fun  
  
Are you looking for a holiday?  
I'm making love for fun  
Why would you do it  
Any other way?  
  
I'm making good  
On everything I said  
So baby just relax  
And let me do my thing  
  
Up in my world  
You better run  
There's only room  
For the few who can come  
  
When you don't have  
A place to go  
When everything  
Feels the same  
I can change what  
  
You think you know  
Making love my way


(Come on. Let me tell you)  
  
Maybe I just want to touch you for your warm inside again  
Maybe I just want to let you the sweetest pleasure is me  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
  
Are you coming to the moment  
When you know your heart can break  
I'm inside you  
I'm around you  
  
Just want to hear you cry again  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why but it just makes me feel like  
  
You don't know how much it hurts when you fall asleep in my arms  
Before the morning comes  
I want to run away, I want to run away  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why but it just makes me feel like


They say I'm crazy, the way you got me open, baby  
They say I'm buggin', the way I'm tight sweatin' your lovin'  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It ain't a question of pride  
  
They say I'm trippin', the way you got my whole life flippin'  
They say I'm losin' it, just can't seem to keep my grip, baby  
We all cry when we feel pain, when love is gone we're not the same  
It ain't a question of brains  
  
Crazy, the way you got me open, baby  
They say I'm buggin', the way I'm tight sweatin' your lovin'  
  
They say I'm slippin' the way you got my whole life flippin'  
They say I'm losin' it, just can't seem to get my grip, baby  
  
They all sit and wonder why the reason this I cannot hide  
It ain't a question of pride


If I had one single wish  
I'd go back to  
The moment  
I kissed you goodbye  
No mater how hard I try  
I can't live  
Without you in my life  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
I walk around  
Trying to understand  
Where we went wrong  
And I can't pretend  
It wasn't me  
And it wasn't you  
But I'm convinced  
We gave up too soon  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
Nothing left to lose  
After losing you  
There's nothing  
I can't take  
When I run to you  
When I come for you  
Don't tell me  
I'm too late  
  
Maybe you'll say  
You still want me  
Maybe you'll say  
That you don't  
Maybe we said  
It was over  
But baby  
I can't let you go  
  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go

Akon, Enrique  
Red One, Konvict  
One day at a time  
  
Saw you in the club  
You were dancing with somebody  
So close so tight  
You were killing me so slowly  
My friends were telling me what you're doing  
Can drive a man so crazy  
Trying to live my life  
It's been 6 months since you left me  
  
So I oh I oh I  
Still thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
It seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
And I know, yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day, one day, one day  
One day at a time  
One day, one day, one day  
One day at a time  
  
I am not the jealous heart  
But you stole my heart baby  
Dancing with that guy  
Made it so hard for me to watch baby  
I just been around running in circle  
I'm going through it in my mind baby  
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls  
To stop from crying out loud baby  
  
Oh I oh I  
Still thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
Can't stop thinking about you baby  
Oh I oh I  
I keep thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know, and I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)  
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)  
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)  
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
It seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
And I know, yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know, yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know, yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time


Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill  
Break your heart and make you love her still  
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill  
  
Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne  
Make you feel so damn alone  
Leave you begging baby come back home  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun  
When your wings melt and you come undone  
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one  
  
She steals your heart just like a thief  
Makes you lay roses at your feet  
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
You thank God you found her  
can't live your life without her  
And every little thing about her is all you need  
All you need  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know, only a woman  
Only a woman


Looking from a window above  
It's like a story of love  
Can you hear me.  
Came back only yesterday  
I'm Moving further away  
Want you near me.  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of your name  
And it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listening to the words that you say  
Getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
Can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
Repeat (2 times):  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you

All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you


Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away  
Body to body we can cause a flame  
We can ignite, ignite, ignite  
  
You wanna dance  
You wanna move

And let the music  
Get you loose

And put yo' hand up  
In the air  
  
You know you want me  
So make a move  
Come over here  
And show me what you're gonna do  
  
Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away

We can ignite, ignite, ignite [x2]  
  
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical oh

Physical, physical  
  
You make me fly  
I'm losing my head  
Don't let me come down  
Pump it up until the end  
  
The club is bumping  
Blow up the roof  
So never mind if we all get a little rude  
  
Move to the right  
Move to the left  
Now back it up you know just  
What you gonna get  
  
You know you like it  
I know you do  
So turn it up and let the beat  
Just get you loose  
  
Tonight we're going all the way  
You want my lips to kiss the pain away  
Body to body we can cause a flame  
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

C'e una cose che potendo non direi  
Mente eri lontana  
Io cercavo lei  
  
Come un lammpo she, rapido  
Ti confonde le idee  
L? Nelle sue braccia  
Mi sentivo da re  
  
Ecco la verit?  
Mi sento disperato  
Vorrei non dire mai  
"Che le ho detto di si"  
Ma con queste parole  
Vado via da qui  
  
Piangerai per me  
Durer? Un minuto  
Non fare cos?  
Non dire cos?  
  
Piangerai per me  
Durer? Un saluto  
Passer? Via cos?  
Passer? Via di qui  
  
Piangerai per me  
Durer? Un minuto  
Non fare cos?  
Non dire cos?  
  
Ecco la verit?  
Mi sento disperato  
Vorrei non dire mai  
"Che le ho detto di si"  
Ma con queste parole  
Vado via da qui  
  
Piangerai per me  
Durer? Un saluto  
Passer? Via cos?  
Passer? Via di qui  
  
Piangerai per me  
Durer? Un minuto

From the coast of Ipanema  
To the Island of Capri  
All the way to Guadeloupe  
I will follow you wherever you may be  
From the moment I first saw you  
Knew my heart could not be free  
Have to hold you in my arms now  
There can never be another for me  
  
All I need is the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica, say you'll be mine  
  
Can you feel the heat of passion?  
Join the dance and let it happen  
Put tomorrow's cares right out of your mind  
As the music draws you closer  
And you fall under my spell  
I will catch you in my arms now  
Where the night will take us no one can tell  
  
All I need is the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music, your heart will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica, say you'll be mine  
  
Gotta have this feeling forever  
Gotta live this moment together  
Nothing else matters just you and the night  
Follow on the wings of desire  
Now the rhythm's taking you higher  
No one can stop us from having it all  
You are my heart you are my soul  
  
All I need it the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music, your hear will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica, say you'll be mine

(Roamer, roamer)  
Hello, I'm coming at your town again  
How's about a night, how's about a flight supernova  
I know, I've been kinda hot and cold  
But you never go away, no matter what I say,  
In the mornings  
  
[Chorus]  
My need is running low  
I've been moving everywhere  
Spreading out my wings, trying everything  
But that's over, 'cause when I'm on my own  
Waking up with someone new  
And now I feel the same, I'm mixing up their name  
It's like a roamer  
  
Goodbye, I'm going on the road again  
But I'm bringing you along,  
In each and every song that we cover  
And I, I always want to see your face  
Cause looking in your eyes, is where I see my life  
When I'm older  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a roamer, like a roamer  
Mississippi, Tennessee  
California , Lexico ,like a roamer  
Russia, San Francisco bay, to the UK,  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer  
  
When I go away, don't want to go away  
Don't want to go away, don't want to go away  
Don't want to go away, don't want to go away  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Mississippi, Tennessee  
California, Lexico, like a roamer  
Russia, Francisco bay, to the UK,  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer


Every day here you come walking  
I hold my tongue,  
I don't' do much talking  
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine  
Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Well for a while I've been watching you steady  
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready  
You show up and then you shy away  
But I know pretty soon you'll be walking this way  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Baby don't you know I don't care  
Don't you know that I've been there  
Well if something in the air feels a little unkind  
Don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind  
I know you think you'd never be mine  
Well that's okay, baby, I don't mind  
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact  
Go ahead, I don't mind the act  
Here you come all dressed up for a date  
Well one more step and it'll be too late  
Blue blue ribbon in you hair  
Like you're so sure I'll be standin there  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie  
Sad eyes never lie


She wakes you up  
Early in the morning  
She tell you babe  
I feel a little horny  
She bring you up and then  
You know you want it  
I like the way  
You give it girl  
Your mouth is dry  
Your heart is beating faster  
You want to die  
You're too afraid to ask her  
She pops the gun  
Your prayers already answered  
Tick tock bang  
Thank you ma'am  
Don't fool yourself  
You can't stop it if you try  
And it's a bumpy ride

She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough

She be the bomb  
Watch out here she come  
You know you're gonna get some  
  
She hits the club and  
Everybody watches  
When she dances  
Everybody wants it  
The kind of girl  
You kinda gotta watch it  
She might just get away  
She makes you wait  
She likes to play  
That kind of game  
She take your money  
You gladly give it all away  
She makes you nasty  
Even want to feel pain  
Then she'll make you  
Born again  
  
Don't fool yourself  
You can't stop it if you try  
And it's a bumpy ride  
  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough

She be the bomb  
Watch out here she come

I know it's late and you're tired  
And we'd been talking for hours here  
You don't have to tell me  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
And I know soon we'll say our goodbyes oh yeah  
I feel it coming  
  
And I hear you take a deep breath  
And my hands are starting to sweat  
I don't want you to  
I don't want you to leave, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
'Cause when your around me  
Everything's right, don't go  
Oh, don't leave me alone  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
I wanna hold you in my arms  
Show you what thats like don't go  
I need you  
I need you  
  
You grab your coat and I'm dying  
But I know that you're still deciding, yeah  
There's no bodies moving  
Time stops and everything's quiet  
I'm begging on for my life in you  
You don't even see it  
  
And then you coming closer  
And baby it's not over  
Till I hear you say  
Till I hear you say  
Goodnight, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Something about you saying is not  
Something about you makes me feel like I'm nobody  
  
Stay here tonight  
Stay here tonight  
Cause when you around me everything's right don't go  
Don't leave me alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight  
I need you  
Stay with me tonight...


The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
There's no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside  
  
And I know you're feeling like you should run away, run away  
And I know you're wandering, oh why you should stay, why you should stay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet, sweet Isabel  
Just believe it won't be alright  
Sweet sweet Isabel  
No you don't have to leave tonight  
  
You feel that change is coming  
But you were so afraid inside  
I know your heart's been broken  
Oh wait too many times  
  
And I know you're feeling like you should run away, run away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(You don't have to leave tonight)  
You don't have to leave tonight  
You don't have to leave tonight  
You don't have to leave tonight  
No you don't  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
There's no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside


It's the way we touch  
Oh feel it, oh feel it  
I was alone, waiting with my fantasies  
Until you came, liberated me  
And taught me so much about humanity  
Yeah-e yeah-e-yeah  
  
I needed you to know  
You're more than just a one night stand  
And girl with your permission  
Baby you can give me your hand  
Not your romance  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Coz it's the way you touch me baby  
Oh it's the way you touch me baby  
If you want we can talk, all night long  
But it's the way you touch me baby  
  
I was alone, grasping for my sanity  
You beauty came free of vanity  
Opened my mind, gave me your anatomy  
Yeah - e - yeah - e - yeah  
  
I needed you to know  
Your more than just a one night stand  
I need some supervision  
I'm losing all control of my hands  
In your command  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Come on baby, oh oh yeah  
Oh baby  
  
You should really know you've got me eating from your hand  
And the ship is gonna blow  
And baby it's not gonna end  
Till your coming  
  
It's the way you touch  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's the way we touch  
It's the way we touch  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh feel it  
Oh oh yeah  
Oh feel it  
Oh oh yeah  
  
[Fade]...


I don't know why  
You want to follow me tonight  
When in the rest of the world  
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled  
Let's me down so  
For a thousand reasons that I know  
To share forever the unrest  
With all the demons I possess  
Beneath the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
Eighth and Ocean Drive  
With all the vampires and their brides  
We're all bloodless and blind  
And longing for a life  
Beyond the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
So far away  
So outer space  
I've trashed myself  
I've lost my way  
I've got to get to you, got to get to you  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon


I know you want me  
I made it obvious that I want you too  
So put it on me  
Let's remove the space between me and you  
Now rock your body  
Damn I like the way that you move  
So give it to me, oh, oh  
Cause I already know what you wanna do  
  
Here's the situation  
Been to every nation  
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do  
You know my motivation

But tonight I'm loving you  
Oh, you know

Turn around and let me see them pants

You, you remember me  
Like I remember you.  
To spend your life...  
Go back in you life, to the time...  
  
I, I walk the streets Alone.  
I can feel you on my own.  
Everyone can see that...  
I really felt, I Don't Know where you're at.  
But You're With Somebody Else.  
  
Chorus  
Somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single Night.  
Somebody Can't Breathe  
Without You it's Lonely  
Somebody hopes that someday you will see...  
  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me.  
  
How, How can we go on.  
It was so good, but now it's gone.  
I pray at night, that I'd pass someone nice  
And, I've Been so Lost.  
You were always right here when I was.  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge --  
You'll Always be in my Life,  
And if I'm not your Life  
You're in my Memory.  
You, You Remember Me  
And Before You Set Me Free.  
Listen Please.  
  
Chorus


Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall  
My mind is running wild tryin' hard not to fall  
You told me that you love me but say I'm just a friend  
My heart is broken up into pieces  
'Cause I know I'll never free my soul  
It's trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna love you  
If you only knew how much I love you  
So why not me  
  
The day after tomorrow I'll still be around  
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down  
You say that we're forever our love will never end  
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know  
You'll never feel my soul  
  
It's trapped between true love and being alone  
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told  
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor  
  
Tell me baby  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You won't ever know  
How far we can go  
You won't ever know  
How far we can go (go)  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
Why oh why tell me why not me  
Why oh why we were meant to be  
Baby I know I could be all you need  
Why oh why oh why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(why not me, why not me)


Funny how the years  
They just pass us by  
Seems like yesterday  
You were in my life  
  
You always wanted  
To start a family  
I was way too young  
I was runnin' free  
  
If you could only see me now  
You'd realize  
I'm not the boy who  
Made you cry  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
I thought I knew it all  
How stupid could I be?  
I think of all I had  
And it makes me weak  
  
If you could only see me now  
You'd realize  
I'm not the boy who  
Made you cry  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
Sometimes  
You hurt the ones who love you most  
And sometimes  
You hold the ones who leave you lost  
And sometimes  
You learn but it's too late  
It's too late  
  
You gave yourself  
I didn't see it  
You died in me  
I should've saved you  
  
You gave yourself  
Why did you give yourself to me?  
You died in me  
Why was I too blind to see?  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Wish you were here with me  
  
Funny how the years  
Just pass us by  


You and I  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
All I need is your hand  
And your heart  
  
Let's be free  
Run away from it all  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Here we are  
Face to face  
One more time  
  
In the light  
In the dark  
We will shine  
  
There's nobody, we're alone-lone-lone  
Take all of your worries, let them go, let them go  
I'll bring you to a place that only we know tonight  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
here we are  
In a field  
Full of stars  
  
We can hide  
From the world  
If we want  
  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
Just you and I  
  
Oh, we go higher baby  
Oh, we go higher baby


Rock rock rock  
Swing baby swing, you're playing with my can  
And it feels right  
Jump baby jump, I'm one step behind  
And it's alright  
You got one mile to go, and your tank is still full  
And you don't stop (no, you don't stop)  
  
[Chorus:]  
You say, hold on tight, for the ride  
Ya, you're my destination  
And you rock me, all night long  
Yeah, you push me, all night long  
Yeah you love me, all night long  
You rock me all night long  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Come baby come, you got me blowing up  
And it feels right  
Slide baby slide, you're not the girl  
To put up a stop sign  
A bullet to my head and they're driving me insane  
And they don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Live baby live, there for today  
Fly baby fly, let's get away  
I don't care what they think, what they say  
And you know, yeah you know  
  
That you rock me  
Yeah, you rock me, oh yeah  
De, de, de, de rock me, all night long  
Yeah you push me, all night long  
Yeah you love me all night long  
You rock me all night long x 3
