I feel like  
I've been watching  
The stars as  
They collide  
The past  
It haunts me  
Yeah  
It kills me  
Every single time  
And now  
My mind  
Is racing  
My heart  
Pounds in my chest  
  
I know  
I have to let you go  
But I just can't forget  
  
I'm so in love  
But I found your lies  
Tell me  
I'm having  
Just a  
Bad dream  
Tonight  
  
Come wake me up  
Tell me love  
That it's all alright  
Tell me  
I'm having  
Just a  
Bad dream  
Tonight  
  
(Bad dream tonight)  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
Come wake me up  
  
I wish  
I never knew  
What  
I somehow  
Figured out  
Lie and tell me  
You don't know  
What I'm talking about  
  
How do I recover  
From these pictures  
In my head?  
You were the love  
Of my life  
I sure hope  
She was worth it


Every week's  
The same  
Stuck in school  
So lame  
My parents say  
That I'm lazy  
Getting up  
At 8 is crazy  
  
Tired of hearing  
What to do  
So unfair  
So uncool  
  
Days too long  
And I'm holding on  
Till I hear  
The bell ring  
  
Cuz it's  
The time when  
The time when  
  
We're gonna breakout  
Let the party start  
We're gonna stay out  
Gonna break  
Some hearts  
  
We're gonna dance  
Till the dance floor  
Falls apart  
Uh, oh  
All over again  
We're gonna wake up  
Everyone we know  
We're gonna have  
Some fun  
Gonna loose control  
  
Feels so good  
To let go-oh-oh  
  
Hangout  
It's something  
We like to do  
With my friends  
Every mess  
Were into ha  
These are  
The lessons  
That we chose  
Not a book  
Full of things  
We'll never use  
  
Days too long  
And I'm holding on  
Till I hear  
The bell ring  
  
Cuz it's  
The time when  
The time when  
  
We're gonna breakout  
Let the party start  
We're gonna stay out  
Gonna break some hearts

I wear the red shoes  
With the holes  
To remind me  
What we went through  
Sit down here  
Kick 'em off enough  
Not had enough of you  
I tell you  
You know  
The car you drive  
Keeps breaking down  
And never starts  
Next thing  
I'm pulling up to you  
We're in the backseat  
Driving it home  
No one wants  
To be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
What do you do?  
What do you do  
When everything  
Is broken?  
What do you say?  
What do you say  
When no words  
Fit the moment?  
'Cause you're not here  
And even if you were  
All I could say  
Is what do I do?  
What do I do?  
We're broken  
But I can't  
Throw us away  
  
The video  
Of our vacation's  
Chewed up in the drawer  
Beside me  
She thinks I never got  
To watch it  
I'm so glad  
I made a copy  
The sky  
Got bitter twisted  
Just like you and me  
I miss it  
You snap it  
Bend it  
Burn it  
Then you find  
That you can't fix it  
Fall back on whatever  
Still remains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Breaking you in  
Breaking your heart  
I was taking it all  
And I tore you apart  
Breaking me in  
Breaking my heart  
And the damage was done  
But I took what you got  
We were breakin' it  
Smashin' it  
Takin' it  
Lovin' it  
Hatin' it  
Drivin' it home  
And now I'm all  
Now I'm all alone  
  
Oh, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do I do?  
We're broken  
But I can't  
Throw us away

She'll be so under my knee  
I'll show her how I'm like

You are my hurt locker lover  
Keep me walking on a wire  
Don't know when you'll blow  
So I tip toe through your triggered mine  
You fight me but I'm on your side  
Defeated, now retreating  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh, this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I don't wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
There's so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
I try to pick off your red flags  
But dancing up on broken glass  
Your mind games hit like glue names  
Your course just like the Kennedys  
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated  
Not retreated  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh, this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I don't wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
Within, so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore, no  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby  
I am not fighting anymore  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
I don't wanna fight no more  
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby  
  
If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)  
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)

If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)  
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)

And I know, yes I know  
If you hold me, believe me

Forever be true

Show me affection  
In all different ways  
Give you my heart  
For the rest of my days  
  
With you all my troubles are left far behind  
Like heaven on earth  
When I look in your eyes  
  
And although there's confusion

I come home in the morning light  
My mother says when you gonna live your life right  
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones  
And girls they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun  
  
The phone rings in the middle of the night  
My father yells what you gonna do with your life  
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one  
But girls they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have  
  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girls they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun Some boys take a beautiful girl  
And hide her away from the rest of the world  
I want to be the one to walk in the sun  
Oh girls they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have  
  
That's all they really want  
Some fun  
When the working day is done  
Girls they want to have fun  
Oh girls just want to have fun,  
They want to have fun,  
They want to have fun...


Oh, sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
You've got  
Too much talent  
I see you  
Through those  
Bloodshot eyes  
There's a cure  
You've found it  
  
Slow motion  
Sparks, You got that chill  
Now don't deny it  
But boys will be boys  
Oh, yes they will  
They don't want  
To define it  
Just give up the game  
And get into me  
If you're looking  
For thrills  
Then get cold feet  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more you try  
The harder I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
I can't cook, no  
But I can clean  
Up the mess you left  
Lay your head down  
And feel the beat  
As I kiss  
Your forehead  
  
This may not  
Last but this is now  
So love the one  
You're with  
You wanna chase  
But you're chasing  
Your tail  
And quick fix  
Won't ever  
Get you well  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Cause I feel  
The distance  
Between us  
Could be over  
With a snap  
Of your fingers  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah  
  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I go slow  
So if you want me  
I don't come cheap  
Keep your thing  
In your pants  
And your heart  
On your sleeve  
Oh, no  
I do not  
Hook up, up  
I fall deep  
Cause the more  
You try  
The harder  
I'll fight  
To say goodnight  
  
Oh, sweetheart  
Put the bottle down  
Cause I don't wanna  
Miss out


This was never the way I planned  
Not my intention  
I got so brave, drink in hand  
Lost my discretion  
It's not what, I'm used to  
Just wanna try you on  
I'm curious for you  
Caught my attention  
  
[Chorus]  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
The taste of her cherry chap stick  
I kissed a girl just to try it  
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it  
It felt so wrong  
It felt so right  
Don't mean I'm in love tonight  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
I liked it  
  
No, I don't even know your name  
It doesn't matter  
You're my experimental game  
Just human nature  
It's not what, good girls do  
Not how they should behave  
My head gets so confused  
Hard to obey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Us girls we are so magical  
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable  
Hard to resist so touchable  
Too good to deny it  
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent  
  
[Chorus]


You come over, don't talk,  
Turn the tv on off,  
Disconnected, I'm affected,  
Better take the call  
Showed you pictures of my hometown,  
A pin could drop from miles down,  
What's the use in tryin' to be a girlfriend, when I know just what we are  
  
There's nothing, in common, except the bed we lay on  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers,  
And it's empty in between  
  
Your a hot-lipped, I can't break,  
Disaster to eliminate,  
What part of no do I not understand, when your not good for me  
  
Cuz I know we will never, be some kind of forever  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers, and it's empty in between,  
Cuz I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing,  
How did we become a one night stand,  
Hanging on a thread just isn't something,  
That I wan't in the end  
  
It's empty in between  
  
You come over, now it's over,  
Yeah I know just what we are  
  
I won't be caught between something and nothing,  
When you know that nothing is for free,  
Cuz in the end it's me who pulls the covers,  
And it's empty in between,  
Cuz I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing,  
How did we become a one night stand,  
Hanging on a thread just isn't something,  
That I wan't in the end  
  
No, whoa it's empty in between


Is Mercury in retrograde or is that the excuse that I've always made  
'Cause I wanna blame you  
But I can only blame myself  
  
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus  
I'll call you crazy, while I'm filling my cup  
I say these things to hurt you  
But I only hurt myself  
  
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah  
  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)  
  
I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues  
I had to grow up, I wish you could too  
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself  
  
Oh, I can only be the changing one to see  
Yeah, to see  
  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah  
  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)  
  
I point my finger but it does me no good  
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah  
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way  
Is it too late to change  
  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just you  
I can't keep ignoring  
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh  
  
It takes two, two sides to every story  
Not just me  
You can't keep ignoring  
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)


Under a silver moon, tropical temperature  
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer  
I want your energy, I want your aura  
You are my destiny, my mantra  
  
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye  
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life  
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary  
  
Go down in history  
Go down together, into infinity, forever  
You're Cleopatra  
You're blushing Juliet  
Anything for your love, a ride or die  
  
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye  
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life  
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary


She is a pyramid  
But with him she's just a grain of sand  
This love's too strong like mice and men  
Squeezing out the life that should be let in  
  
She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane  
But now she's just a gust of wind  
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships  
Was a force to be reckoned with  
  
She could be a Statue of Liberty  
She could be a Joan of Arc  
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her  
So he keeps her in the dark  
  
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh  
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh  
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself  
'Cause she used to be a pearl  
  
She was unstoppable  
Moved fast as light, like an avalanche  
But now she's stuck deep in cement  
Wishing that they'd never ever met  
  
She could be a Statue of Liberty  
She could be a Joan of Arc  
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her  
So he keeps her in the dark  
  
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh  
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh  
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself  
'Cause she used to be a  
  
Do you know that there's a way out,  
There's a way out  
There's a way out  
There's a way out  
  
You don't have to be held down,  
Be held down  
Be held down  
Be held down  
  
'Cause I used to be a shell  
Yeah, I let him rule my world  
My world, oh, yeah  
  
But I woke up and grew strong  
And I can still go on  
And no one can take my pearl  
  
You don't have to be shell, no  
You're the one that rules your world, oh  
You are strong and you'll learn  
That you can still go on  
  
And you'll always be a pearl  
  
She is unstoppable


You're such a poet  
I wish I could be Wesley Willis  
My words would flow like honey  
Sweet and laid on thick  
You're so edgy  
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary  
I wipe my hands on your jeans  
Cause they are more distressed  
So they say you've got a CD  
And they claim you can barely read  
But you say don't bother me with all of your reality  
  
But it could be so simple  
(you were thinking)  
Life should be that simple  
(Who would have thought it)  
I wish it were just so simple  
(don't know what you were thinking)  
But the point's been missed  
You've made a mess  
Who would have guessed  
That it's as simple as it seems  
  
So what, you're a genius  
But you've got a lot to learn  
Like the time you lost your apartment  
Cause you bought too much Vuitton  
You park in a loading zone  
You sleep with the lights all on  
You cross your I's and dot your t's  
All it goes to show  
  
That it could be so simple  
(you were thinking)  
Life should be that simple  
(Who would have thought it)  
I wish it were just that simple  
(don't know what you were thinking)  
The point's been missed  
We've made a mess  
Who would have guessed  
That it's as simple as it seems  
  
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake  
Just take a moment to reevaluate  
The possibilities  
The situations  
The opportunities  
That are waiting  
Oh, the possibilities  
Oh, I  
  
It could, it could be that simple  
(you were thinking)  
Life should be that simple  
(Who would have thought it)  
I wish it were just so simple  
(don't know what you were thinking)  
You're in a haze  
It's just a phase  
You know this maze  
Is as simple as it seems  
  
We could talk all day  
About your eccentricities  
What I mean to say  
Oh, is that I need you listen please  
And focus on life's simplicities  
So don't be afraid to strip it away  
Cause at the end of the day  
It's still as simple as it seems  
  
It is all so simple  
Just deal with it


If You came by me  
Would I crown You my King  
Or brush You off as though  
I really didn't see  
If You walked by my side  
Would our souls then be unified  
I swore Your name  
Would never be denied  
  
But I took up this hammer  
And laughed at all Your slander  
And pierced Your hands  
With the nails of blasphemy  
How could I do this? I don't know  
Said something forced me to it, so  
Spit in Your face and passed You by  
(I'd forgotten those words  
"Your name won't be denied")  
  
But time and time again  
I'd live that life of sin  
I knew it hurt you bad  
But I wasn't ready to give in  
"Maybe someday,"  
But not this day I said  
I wanted to live my life  
I was willing to pay the price  
  
Chorus  
  
But looking into my eyes  
I knew You felt this heart's cry  
I needed You  
Bad my life was oh so sad  
But looking back at all this pain,  
This guilt, this strife  
Would You take it all away  
If I were to give you back my life?  
  
But You said  
"I've forgiven thee"  
And You said  
"I've forgiven thee" (repeat)  
  
He was hanging on a cross  
With a crown of thorns  
In His head (repeat)  
  
But You said  
"I've forgiven thee"  
And You said  
"I've forgiven thee" (repeat)


Comparisons are easily done  
Once you've had a taste of perfection  
Like an apple hanging from a tree  
I picked the ripest one  
I still got the seed  
  
You said move on  
Where do I go  
I guess second best  
Is all I will know  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when I'm with him  
I am thinking of you  
Thinking of you  
What you would do if  
You were the one  
Who was spending the night  
Oh I wish that I  
Was looking into your eyes  
  
You're like an Indian summer  
In the middle of winter  
Like a hard candy  
With a surprise center  
How do I get better  
Once I've had the best  
You said there's  
Tons of fish in the water  
So the waters I will test  
  
He kissed my lips  
I taste your mouth  
He pulled me in  
I was disgusted with myself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're the best  
And yes I do regret  
How I could let myself  
Let you go  
Now the lesson's learned  
I touched it I was burned  
Oh I think you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looking into your eyes  
Looking into your eyes  
Oh won't you walk through  
And bust in the door  
And take me away  
Oh no more mistakes  
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay


Can you tell me  
Who called the race?  
Can anyone stay in one place?  
And when you get to the finish line  
Will you wish for more time or say  
  
One day  
One day you will  
But maybe one day you will find  
That you just can't push rewind  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
Be here with me now  
  
Do you ever think that  
We're just chasing our tails?  
Like life is one big fast treadmill  
And we pop what is prescribed  
If it gets us first prize but you know  
Who I  
Who I think will win  
Are the ones that love loving  
Are the ones that take the time  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
Be here with me now  
Be here with me now  
  
'Cause refuge check is right now, right in front on you  
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do  
If you check right now, I'm in front of you  
Baby don't blink and miss  
  
This moment  
Tomorrow's unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me?  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why don't you be here with me yeah  
Be here with me now


Greetings loved ones, let's take a journey  
Yeah, the o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one  
Uh-huh, baby you're a California girl  
  
Let's go all the way tonight  
No regrets, just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I will be young forever  
You make me feel like I'm livin' a  
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on  
I can't sleep  
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back  
My heart stops when you look at me  
Just one touch, now baby I believe this is real  
So take a chance and  
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back  
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans  
Be your teenage dream tonight  
Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans  
Be your teenage dream tonight  
Yeah!  
  
I know a place  
Where the grass is really greener  
Warm, wet and wild  
There must be something in the water  
You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
You'll be falling in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
California girls, we're unforgettable  
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top  
Sun kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt you popsicle  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
California girls, we're undeniable  
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock  
West coast represent, now put your hands up  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
In another life  
I would be your girl  
We'd keep all our promises  
Be us against the world  
In another life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were  
The one that got away, the one that got away  
The o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one, the one (x3)  
In another life  
I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were  
The one that got away  
  
There's a stranger in my bed  
There's a pounding in my head  
Glitter all over the room  
Pink flamingos in the pool  
I smell like a mini bar  
D J's passed out in the yard  
Barbie's on the barbecue  
This a hickie or a bruise?  
Pictures of last night ended up online  
I'm screwed, oh well  
It's a blacktop blur  
But I'm pretty sure it ruled  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we danced on table tops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar  
So we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark  
Then had a menage a trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say we're gonna stop, oh whoa oh  
This Friday night, do it all again  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F.  
T.G.I.F  
T.G.I.F.  
  
You're so hypnotizing  
Could you be the devil  
Could you be an angel  
Your touch magnetizing  
Feels like I am floating  
Leaves my body glowing  
They say be afraid  
You're not like the others  
Futuristic lover  
Different DNA  
They don't understand you  
You're from a whole nother world  
A different dimension  
You've opened my eyes  
Now I'm ready to go  
Lead me into the light  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your lovin  
Fill me with your poison  
Take me, ta-ta-take me  
Wanna be your victim  
Ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien  
Your touch so foreign  
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
Do you ever feel  
Like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
Do you ever feel  
Feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
Do you ever feel  
Already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
Cause there's a spark in you  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the 4th of July  
Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show em what you're worth  
Make em go oh oh oh  
When you shoot across the sky-y-y  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon  
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon


How could I see you when I was so blind  
How could I grasp you when I was far behind  
How could I hear you when I was so deaf  
How could I get up when I had been left  
  
But You said, "don't worry"  
For I've healed the blind man  
And I've set the captives free  
And You said, "don't worry"  
For all you've gotta do  
Is put your trust in Me  
  
How could I be clean  
When I was so dirty  
How could I be made whole  
When I was torn apart  
Make me whole, make me whole  
Make me whole again


Oh no, did I get too close oh?  
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?  
All your insecurities  
All the dirty laundry  
Never made me blink one time  
  
Unconditional, unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
There is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
I will love you unconditionally  
  
Come just as you are to me  
Don't need apologies  
Know that you are worthy  
I'll take your bad days with your good  
Walk through this storm I would  
I'd do it all because I love you, I love you  
  
Unconditional, unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
There is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
I will love you unconditionally  
  
So open up your heart and just let it begin  
Open up your heart, and just let it begin  
Open up your heart, and just let it begin  
Open up your heart  
Acceptance is the key to be  
To be truly free  
Will you do the same for me?  
  
Unconditional, unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
And there is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
'Cause I will love you unconditionally (oh yeah)  
  
I will love you  
I will love you  
I will love you unconditionally


I know you know my boyfriend is out of town  
So have a drink, let's talk it over  
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now  
You know I like my boys a little bit older  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight. tonight, tonight  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
All my girls are nowhere to be found  
They all split when I'm in trouble  
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around  
The 'undercover-lovers' under the covers  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight. tonight, tonight  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
I just wanna use your l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e, l-o-v-e  
  
try to keep my head from spinning  
Too much to drink, not making sense  
Been a while since I've been with someone new  
But I can't stop the way I'm feeling  
  
As you leave please would you just close the door  
Now that our love affair is over  
You're exactly what I was looking for  
We'll go find a shoulder to cry upon  
  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
I just wanna use your love  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!  
I don't wanna lose your love tonight  
  
(You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all to me  
You don't mean nothing at all  
  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
I think I'm done fuck'n singing this song  
Singing this song, song, song song


We're looking in the same direction  
But you don't see what I see  
Just a half moon in your perception  
It looks full to me  
Oh my head is caught, caught in clouds  
But your buried so, so far down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way your pulling me  
You're worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
Your words can pollute the future  
So you should choose carefully  
Cynical is a natural born killer  
If it were up to me I would say  
Lets get you all medicated  
So we can get dedicated  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way you're pulling me  
You're worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
This is not a race  
This is the relationship  
But you take the cake at being the worst in it  
Try and keep me grounded  
You took my faith and nearly drowned it  
  
This is not a test  
This is the relationship  
You are the best in being Mr. Negative  
  
You weigh me down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way you're pulling me  
You're worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way you're pulling me  
You're worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
You weigh me down (me down)


When there's nothing  
Left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before  
When there's nothing  
Left left to say  
I'll say it all again,  
But until then...  
  
And I'll give you my heart,  
Say I love you  
Say I love you  
And I'll give you my heart,  
Say I love you  
Oh, cause I do, Jesus  
  
No music to play  
So I sing you my own song  
Come on and sing along  
When there's nothing that remains  
You still stay the same  
You're looking so strong  
  
CHORUS  
  
When there's nothing left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all  
Your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white  
Christmas with you  
Jingle Bells  
All the way, all the way


Yeah, eh yeah yeah  
  
I can feel a phoenix inside of me,  
As I march alone to a different beat,  
Slowly slowing down my fear,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I am ready for the road less traveled,  
Suiting up for my crowning battle,  
This test is my own cross to bare,  
But I will get there  
  
It's never easy to be chosen,  
Never easy to be called,  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,  
I can see the Heavens,  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can feel this light that's inside of me,  
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning,  
I know one spark will shock the world,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
So I pray for favor like Ester,  
I need Your strength to handle the pressure,  
I know there will be sacrifice,  
But that's the price  
  
It's never easy to be chosen,  
Never easy to be called,  
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,  
I can see the Heavens,  
But I still hear the flames calling out my name  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,  
Don't let the greatness get you down  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,  
Don't let the greatness get you down  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
I can see the writing on the wall,  
I can't ignore this war,  
At the end of it all,  
Who am I living for?  
  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?  
At the end, at the end,  
Who am I living for?


I saw you  
At the grocery store  
Oh  
You both looked happy  
Picking out the usual  
She's a carbon copy  
Of everything you lost  
Of everything I'm not  
I guess you just forgot  
How to pick 'em  
  
If she's the one  
I've heard about  
I'm disappointed  
If she's the reason  
Why you left  
I'm not impressed at all  
Well  
This looks like the end  
Yeah  
We can still be friends  
Congratulations  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
'Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me again  
  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
Well, someone had  
To tell the truth  
And I'm always honest  
I read you  
Like an open book  
And it's obvious to me  
She's just  
The one between  
Heading no where fast  
Sure  
It's gonna last forever  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
'Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
'Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me again  
  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
Oh, you wish  
You wish  
You wish  
You do


[Verse 1]  
If I lost it all today, what would you take?  
Would my love be enough to stimulate?  
Shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown  
Would you still show, oh?  
Could you go down with me into the night?  
Could we get back up beneath, eventually love?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
I get myself tonight, oh  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
We are just looking for a connection  
Yeah, we all want to be seen  
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language  
Someone to ride this ride with me  
Can I get a witness, witness?  
Will you be my witness, witness?  
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this  
Looking for a witness to get me through this  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you tell me everything, theres no holes  
You can scroll through anything, you got the codes  
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes  
And we just know, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
I get myself tonight, oh  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
We are just looking for a connection  
Yeah, we all want to be seen  
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language  
Someone to ride this ride with me  
Can I get a witness, witness?  
Will you be my witness, witness?  
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this  
Looking for a witness to get me through this


I take these turns  
A bit too fast  
Trying to leave you  
In my past  
The cd skips  
Our favorite songs  
Our greatest hits  
Just don't belong  
  
I really love  
To hate this  
Love hate  
Hate love relationships  
Are over-rated  
Over my dead body  
Is how this will end  
He said it's over  
And I could go for  
Another chance to do  
This over again  
  
So this is it?  
After all  
We've been thru  
We call it quits  
And-a I'm about to  
Wash my prints  
Oh  
The little I had left  
He said it's over  
And I could really go  
For a cup of coffee  
And an overdose  
  
Leave it all behind me  
You'll see it  
When you finally find me  
Comatose or pretty close  
Cover up copy  
And an overdose  
  
I pop these pills  
Like cracker jacks  
And the price  
That plays dice  
Just watching you react  
When your depressed you  
Sleep too much  
I'm not sure  
If I'm waking up  
  
It's over-rated  
Over my dead body  
Is how this will end  
You said it'd over  
And I could go  
For another chance to do  
This over again  
  
So this is it?  
After all  
We've been thru  
We call it quits  
And-a I'm about  
To wash my prints  
Oh  
The little I had left  
He said it's over  
And I could really go  
For a cup of coffee  
And an overdose  
  
Leave it all behind me  
You'll see it  
When you finally find me  
Comatose or pretty close  
Cup of coffee  
And an overdose  
  
He said it's over  
And I could really go  
For a cup of coffee  
And an overdose  
Leave it all behind me  
You'll see it  
When you finally find me  
Comatose or pretty close  
  
I stood in line  
Without you  
I stood in line  
Without you  
And I don't tell you  
What it is  
I thought about you  
Well without you  
Is everything I've got


I will never be, I will never be tall, no  
And I will never be, never ever be sure of it all  
Oh, why's the world so cruel to me?  
When all, all I ever wanna be is anything I'm not  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not, I'm not  
  
I will never be, I will never be you, no  
I will always be, I will always be me, that I know  
But oh, even though I'm happy being me  
I want to get away from all this harsh reality, oh  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not  
  
Yeah, gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Oh, anything I'm not  
  
Gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different  
Anything I'm not  
  
Yeah, gimme a break, a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free, I want to be new and different  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Anything I'm not, anything I'm not  
Anything I'm not


If I ever broke up with you, I regret it. If I find a picture of me alone,  
It would be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad photograph. If I ever dumped you,  
Never ment it. If I find a memorie by myself, it's badly, badly, badly,  
Badly cursed for my memories. If I ever wanted you back, I think I would  
Run fast. I want you, you want me.  
If I ever broke up with you, I regret it. If I find a picture of me alone,  
It would be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad photograph.  
  
What the heck was I thinking running away like that? How stupid of me, yeah  
Yeah.


If the fish swam out of the ocean  
And grew legs and they started walking  
And the apes climbed down from the trees  
And grew tall and they started talking  
  
And the stars fell out of the sky  
And my tears rolled into the ocean  
Now I'm looking for a reason why  
You even set my world into motion  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then the stars don't even matter  
Now I'm filled to the top with fear  
That it's all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then I don't wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold  
  
I looked up into the gray sky  
And see a thousand eyes staring back  
And all around these golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel the weight of something beyond them  
I don't see what I can feel  
If vision is the only validation  
Then most of my life isn't real  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then the stars don't even matter  
Now I'm filled to the top with fear  
That it's all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then I don't wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then the stars don't even matter  
Now I'm filled to the top with fear  
That it's all just a bunch of matter  
  
Cause if you're not really here  
Then I don't wanna be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold  
Black and gold, black and gold  
Black and gold, black and gold


I was living in a small mind with no lifeline  
And no messages can reach me from the outside  
When I looked out over the horizon  
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising  
  
Then it hit me, maybe bit me  
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me  
I didn't know exactly where I would be going  
But I had to let this river in me flowing  
  
What a ride  
When you open your eyes  
For the very first time  
A real surprise  
  
I started living outside of the box  
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop  
Living outside of the box  
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back, found some motivation  
I've been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive  
  
I was living on a fault line, the fault was all mine  
And this unstable ground found me down half the time  
But I had enough, I had to get up  
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff  
  
Then it hit me, you won't permit me  
To be an individual just doesn't fit me  
But I decided that it's going to be living  
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison  
  
What a high  
When you open your mind  
For the very first time  
A real surprise  
  
I started living outside of the box  
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop  
Living outside of the box  
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back, found some motivation  
I've been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive  
  
So long conformity  
And ambiguality is a new priority  
All it takes, for heaven sakes  
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate  
  
I started living outside for the box  
Taking my time when I always used to rush  
Living outside of the box  
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not  
  
I always knew this day would come  
When I broke down the walls for my liberation  
I've been living on the other side  
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive  
  
Oh, living outside of the box  
Oh, living outside of the box  
Oh, living outside  
  
Ha ha ha  
I always knew this day would come  
When I got off my back, found some motivation  
Oh, living outside of the box, of the box, of your life  
Of everything that seems that nice


The weight of my words  
Are like feathers from a bird  
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing  
Cause I've dug myself deep  
I managed to fit both my hands and feet  
All my little white lies  
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach  
  
In one ear  
And out your other  
So lock and key  
You won't open up for me  
  
So brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
  
I guess  
And it feels like you're in China  
And I am in Peru  
When ever I am sleeping next to you  
We can hear the crickets singing  
Oh all throughout the night  
OH boy can we just get used  
To something so right'  
  
And sure I confess  
I'm a mess  
I'm a mess of mistakes  
But please count to ten  
Before you go and throw it all away  
  
So brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
On on on us  
  
Cause if you give up  
Then what am I supposed to do  
All these dreams  
Never will come true  
Without you  
Vocal ad lib  
  
Brick by brick  
I am breaking through these walls  
Oh between you and me  
I'm not giving up  
I'm not giving giving up  
  
Oh baby don't give up  
On this love  
Don't give up  
On this love


Was 27 surviving my return to Saturn  
A long vacation didn't sound so bad  
Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron melting  
Running on empty, so out of gas  
  
Thought I wasn't enough and I wasn't so tough  
Laying on the bathroom floor  
We were living on a fault line  
And I felt the fault was all mine  
Couldn't take it any more  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
That way  
  
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water  
When the truth was like swallowing sand  
Now every morning  
There is no more morning oh I  
Can finally see myself again  
  
I know I am enough  
Possible to be loved  
It was not about me  
Now I have to rise above  
Let the universe call the bluff  
Yeah the truth will set you free  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
  
That way no  
There ain't no  
Not in the name of love  
In the name of love (in the name of love)  
That way  
There ain't no  
I'm not giving up  
  
By the grace of God  
I picked myself back up  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)  
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
That way

[Intro]  
Oh, when we go numb  
Oh, when we come down  
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right  
  
[Verse 1]  
Drift away  
The haze slows down the pulse  
Latency  
A mind of cruise control  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Well I'll give you all or nothing  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Is what I've got, trust me  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
We escape  
We're lying on the moon  
Stay awake  
To see the naked truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Well I'll give you all or nothing  
What you want?  
What you need?  
Is what I've got, trust me  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, when we go numb  
Oh, when we come down  
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right  
  
[Chorus]  
Static, static, static, moves, oh  
Static, static, stuck on you  
Static, static, moves, oh, oh


We woke up late, said goodbye  
Now I'm standing outside on the street  
I walk through the city  
I'm laughing, bouquets staring down at my feet  
  
And I look up and this sky might fall  
Open up and pull me in  
I feel like an angel who's fallen  
I just got to have this first taste of original sin  
  
Damn, can you feel it?  
Damn, I can't believe it  
Damn, you got me feelin' good  
  
Damn, do you dig it?  
That's the way you do it  
Damn, you know, you give it good  
  
Two minutes later  
I'm counting the seconds and hours to go  
I'm working a sweat out of bed  
Just the thought of you is making me glow  
  
I'm goin' about it, you gave it good  
You're back up, can't just leave it alone  
I'm walking from acres across  
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own  
  
Damn, can you feel it?  
Damn, I can't believe it  
Damn, you got me feelin' good  
  
Damn, do you dig it?  
That's the way you do it  
Damn, you know, you give it good  
  
You got my tongue, it's so tied  
My eyes are open wide  
And my hair is standing up on my skin  
And I keep sayin'  
  
Damn, do you dig it?  
That's the way you do it  
Damn, you know, you give it good  
  
Waltz through the door and into your room  
Cause this whole world lies  
But you tell me the truth  
  
Think I'll give you up?  
You're not gonna let me down  
Your love is like an ocean  
And I'm starting to drown  
  
Damn, can you feel it?  
Damn, I can't believe it  
Damn, you got me feelin' good  
  
Damn, do you dig it?  
That's the way you do it  
Damn, you know, you give it good  
  
You got my tongue, it's so tied  
My eyes are open wide  
And my hair is standing up on my skin  
And I keep sayin'  
  
Damn, do you dig it?  
That's the way you do it  
Damn, you know, you give it good  
  
Oh yeah, yeah  
I can't believe it, I can't believe it  
Oh yeah, you got me feelin' good  
Good, good, good


I knew you were  
You were gonna come to me  
And here you are  
But you better choose carefully  
'Cause I am capable of anything  
Of anything and everything  
  
Make me your Aphrodite  
Make me your one and only  
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for, ready for  
A perfect storm, a perfect storm  
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine  
There's no going back  
  
Mark my words  
This love will make you levitate  
Like a bird  
Like a bird without a cage  
But down to earth  
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away  
  
It's in the palm of your hand now baby  
It's a yes or no, no maybe  
So just be sure before you give it up to me  
Up to me, give it up to me  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for, ready for  
A perfect storm, a perfect storm  
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine  
There's no going back  
  
She's a beast  
I call her Karma  
She eat your heart out  
Like Jeffrey Dahmer  
Be careful  
Try not to lead her on  
Shawty's heart was on steroids  
'Cause her love was so strong  
  
You may fall in love  
When you meet her  
If you get the chance you better keep her  
She swears by it but if you break her heart  
She turn cold as a freezer(freezer)  
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor  
She can be my Sleeping Beauty  
I'm gon' put her in a coma  
  
Woo! Damn I think I love her  
Shawty so bad  
I'm sprung and I don't care  
She got me like a roller coaster  
Turn the bedroom into a fair  
Her love is like a drug  
I was tryna hit it and quit it  
But lil' mama so dope  
I messed around and got addicted  
  
So you wanna play with magic  
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for  
Baby do you dare to do this  
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse  
  
Are you ready for, ready for  
A perfect storm, a perfect storm  
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine  
There's no going back


I've got people to see, places to go  
Deadlines to meet, a reputation to uphold  
It's like a ton of bricks breaking on my back  
It's like the force of gravity in full effect  
  
I got money to burn and I'm on the sake  
They bet their bomb on me 'cause I'm their ace of spades  
I feel the walls getting closer  
I'm like a bomb with all red wires  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe it means I'm gonna be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe this means I'm gonna be  
  
A diamond, it won't ever bend  
A diamond, 'cause they're ladies, best friends  
A diamond, but there, there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
If not for the push I'd probably be a pebble  
If not for the pressure I'd be forgotten forever  
Just another stone skipped upon the water  
Drowning fast before the other failures  
  
I don't wanna be a distant memory on your wall  
Just another cd that you burned and never bought  
Am I not worth it to you after all that drama  
That we've been though?  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe it means I'm gonna be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe this means I'm gonna be  
  
A diamond, it won't ever bend  
A diamond, 'cause they're ladies, best friends  
A diamond, but there, there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
Ooh ooh, diamond  
I've gotta be a diamond  
(I'm a diamond in the sky)  
(With you standing by)  
(Now catch me if I fall)  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Oh, I've gotta be, oh, I've gotta be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Oh, I've gotta be, oh, I've gotta be  
  
I'm a diamond in the sky  
With you standing by  
Now catch me if I fall  
Into the arms of a coma  
  
All this pressure, I've got pressure  
I'm gonna be a diamond, baby, I've gotta be a diamond  
You're gonna see, I'm gonna be a diamond


You're a one of a one  
A one of a kind  
That you only find once in a lifetime  
Made to fit like a fingerprint  
A code that clicks open a gold mine  
  
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure  
When I found you, it was all pretty better  
  
Secretly, I hit the lottery 'cause you're  
Brighter than all of the Northern the Lights  
You speak to me, even in my dreams, wouldn't  
Let you go for even the highest price  
  
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure  
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
Was a phenomenon when you came along, yeah  
Chemistry was more than science  
It was deafening, loud like  
lightning, it was striking, you couldn't deny it  
  
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure  
The two of us together, make everything glitter  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you  
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you  
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind  
  
(Ooh ooh ooh)  
  
'Cause I understand you,  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go (I go up for you)  
So will I  
'Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
It's hard to find  
Oh it's hard to find  
Once in a lifetime ah  
  
Once in a lifetime  
Once in a lifetime


(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you, for you)  
(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you)  
  
Saucer of milk, table for two  
You wanna pet my kitty?  
You're such a dirty doggy.  
It's your lucky night 'cause I'm in the mood,  
Oh, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty.  
  
Pick a part, you dream it up.  
A dark vixen, a Lolita.  
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,  
Tonight I'm dressing up for you.  
  
I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath  
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test.  
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest  
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer.  
  
Pick a part, you dream it up.  
Librarian, dominatrix.  
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,  
Tonight's the night  
  
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,  
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,  
Are you ready for your blood to rise?  
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.  
  
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse  
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature  
Better behave, or a police officer will have to hold you down  
Give you what you deserve  
  
Pick a part, you dream it up.  
Use your imagination  
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy,  
Tonight's the night  
  
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,  
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,  
Are you ready for your blood to rise?  
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.  
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,  
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,  
Are you ready for your blood to rise?  
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.  
  
Tied, tight, tip, teasing  
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing  
Beads of sweat drip down your neck,  
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak  
Trembling, trembling, trembling  
  
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,  
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,  
Are you ready for your blood to rise?  
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.  
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,  
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,  
Are you ready for your blood to rise?  
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.  
  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up for you  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up  
For you  
I'm dressin' up  
I'm dressin' up for you


All along the western front  
People line up to receive.  
She got the power in her hand  
To shock you like you won't believe.  
Saw her in the amazon  
With the voltage running through her skin  
Standing there with nothing on  
She gonna teach me how to swim  
  
I said ooh girl  
Shock me like an electric eel  
Baby girl  
Turn me on with your electric feel  
  
I said ooh girl  
Shock me like an electric eel  
Baby girl  
Turn me on with your electric feel  
  
All along the eastern shore  
Put your circuits in the sea  
This is what the world is for  
Making electricity  
You can feel it in your mind  
Oh you can do it all the time  
Plug it in and change the world  
You are my electric girl.  
  
I said ooh girl  
Shock me like an electric eel

You're so hypnotizing  
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel  
Your touch magnetizing  
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing  
  
They say be afraid  
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers  
Different DNA, they don't understand you  
  
You're from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
You're so supersonic  
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers  
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic  
  
You're from a whole other world  
A different dimension  
You open my eyes  
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial  
  
There is this transcendental, on another level  
Boy, you're my lucky star  
I wanna walk on your wave length  
And be there when you vibrate  
For you I risk it all, all  
  
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me  
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison  
Take me, t-t-take me  
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial  
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial  
  
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign  
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial


[Verse 1]  
My fire through cold nights  
The brightest of all lights  
You are my home  
Wherever we go  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
You're giving me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, you are the reason  
  
[Verse 2]  
My heart can't stop singing  
You can't fight this feeling  
Unspeakable joy  
Ringing through my soul  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
You're giving me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, you are the reason  
  
[Bridge]  
We don't need a thing under the tree  
Cause you give me all I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason, when you're the reason  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason to celebrate  
Every day is a holiday  
When you're the reason


You could throw me  
In the fire  
And I won't be burned  
For my faith  
Is Your desire  
And Your love endures  
  
You could throw me  
In the prison cell  
Shackle me up  
Against the rail  
But time  
And time again  
My faith won't fail  
  
[Chorus:]  
For He'll prevail  
In the midst of all  
My trials  
And tribulations  
And He'll prevail  
In the midst of all  
My sin  
And temptations  
He'll prevail  
When I fall  
And He  
Will pick me up  
For time  
And time again  
My faith won't fail  
Time and time again  
My faith won't fail  
  
You could cast me  
In the lion's den  
But they won't harm me  
For Your grace  
Surrounds me  
And it sets me free  
  
And I can walk  
Upon the water  
And I will not drown  
For my eyes are  
Set upon You  
And no one  
Can bring me down  
  
For His angels  
Surround me  
And You've poured out  
This blood covering  
And I will walk  
And not fail  
For time  
And time again  
My faith won't fail  
Time  
And time again  
My faith won't fail


Voted most likely to end up on the back OK a milk box drink  
Looks like I'm letting them down  
'Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth and hour of my hard work and time  
When you cant afford half the shit they advertise  
Oh I'm worth more then they ask more then the two-tag generation full of
regret  
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype  
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight  
It's my life  
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you  
  
Representing you and me  
Don't you wanna go down in history?  
Rather then end up begging on the streets  
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep  
'Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin  
I can't focus my attention  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
Don't give up  
Don't give in  
Because your arms on the rock  
Oh I'm not innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent  
  
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
(I want you to remember me)  
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end


Do you ever feel like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind  
Wanting to start again  
  
Do you ever feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards  
One blow from caving in  
  
Do you ever feel already buried deep  
Six feet under screams  
But no one seems to hear a thing  
  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
'Cause there's a spark in you  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em falling down down down  
  
You don't have to feel like a waste of space  
You're original, cannot be replaced  
If you only knew what the future holds  
After a hurricane comes a rainbow  
  
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed  
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road  
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow  
And when it's time, you'll know  
  
You just gotta ignite the light  
And let it shine  
Just own the night  
Like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe-awe-awe  
  
Boom, boom, boom  
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon  
And it's always been inside of you you you  
And now it's time to let it through  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on show 'em what your worth  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
Baby you're a firework  
Come on let your colors burst  
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"  
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe


I used to know you when we were young  
You were in all my dreams  
We sat together in period one  
Fridays at 8: 15  
Now I see face in the strangest places  
Movies and magazines  
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken  
On my tv screen  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
I'll be here for you  
  
I used to work in a record store  
Now I work for my dad  
Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors  
The hours are pretty bad  
Sometimes I wonder where you are  
Probably in L. A.  
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
I'll be here for you  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
I'll be here for you  
If you ever get back to Hackensack  
I'll be here for you


You change your mind  
Like a girl changes clothes  
Yeah you, PMS  
Like a bitch  
I would know  
  
And you over think  
Always speak  
Cryptically  
  
I should know  
That you're no good for me  
  
'Cause you're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
You're wrong when it's right  
It's black and it's white  
We fight, we break up  
We kiss, we make up  
(You) You don't really want to stay, no  
(You) But you don't really want to go-o  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
  
We used to be  
Just like twins  
So in sync  
The same energy  
Now's a dead battery  
Used to laugh bout nothing  
Now you're plain boring  
  
I should know that  
You're not gonna change  
  
'Cause you're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
You're wrong when it's right  
It's black and it's white  
We fight, we break up  
We kiss, we make up  
(You) You don't really want to stay, no  
(You) But you don't really want to go-o  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
  
Someone call the doctor  
Got a case of a love bi-polar  
Stuck on a roller coaster  
Can't get off this ride  
  
You change your mind  
Like a girl changes clothes  
  
'Cause you're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
You're wrong when it's right  
It's black and it's white  
We fight, we break up  
We kiss, we make up  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down  
You're wrong when it's right  
It's black and it's white  
We fight, we break up  
We kiss, we make up  
(You) You don't really want to stay, no  
(You) But you don't really want to go-o  
You're hot then you're cold  
You're yes then you're no  
You're in then you're out  
You're up then you're down, down.


You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity  
The first time, every time when you touchin' me,  
I make you bloom like the flower that you never seen  
Under the sun we are one buzzin' energy  
  
Let's pollinate, let's create a family tree  
This evolution with you comes naturally  
Some call it science,  
We call it chemistry  
This is the story of the birds and the bees  
  
Even the seasons change  
Our love still stays the same  
  
You give me that  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Flown a million miles just to find the magic seed  
Oh I would flower with the power that bring light to me  
Your so exotic, my whole body fluttering  
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet  
  
Always on the brink of a heart attack  
You keep me alive and keep me coming back  
I see the sun rise in your eyes  
Your eyes  
You gotta future full of blue skies  
Blue skies  
  
Even when seasons change  
I'm still stay the same  
  
You give me that  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
You love me, you love me never love me not  
Not  
Oh no  
When we're in perfect harmony  
You make me sound like, like a symphony  
  
Oh your wings could make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Spread my wings and make me fly  
The taste of your honey is so sweet  
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hey yeah  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hey yeah  
Hummingbird heartbeat  
Hummingbird heartbeat


I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks  
He introduced me, was always just a friend  
I bought a new dress, he never noticed  
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge  
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them  
I think I'm ready, to be a woman  
  
Oh love, I think I'm ready  
Ready for it  
  
You were such a surprise  
An unexpected gift  
Said I was pretty, and I believed it  
Not really used to all this attention  
Told myself I don't deserve you  
And this is just a phase  
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?  
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say  
  
Oh love, I think I'm ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love, I think I'm ready  
  
Cause you send me flowers, when there's no occasion  
Yeah we talk for hours, you still wanna listen  
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight  
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day  
So scared to feel this way but love, I think I'm ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love, I think I'm ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love, I think I'm ready


What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?  
Say, did you come alone or did you bring all your friends?  
Say, whats your name, what you drinking  
I think I know what you're thinking  
Baby what's your sign, tell me yours I'll tell you mine  
Say, whats somebody like you doing in a place like this  
One, two, three, come one  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never be the same, if we ever meet again  
Won't let you get away, said, if we ever meet again  
This free fall's, got me so  
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go  
I'll never be the same  
If we ever meet again  
  
Say if we ever meet again  
  
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before  
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more  
Baby tell me what's your story  
I ain't shy, don't you worry  
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight  
So do you come here much, I gotta see your face some more, some more  
  
Cause baby I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If we ever meet again  
I'll have so much more to say (if we ever meet again)  
  
If we ever meet again  
I won't let you go away (said if we ever meet again)  
  
If we ever meet again  
I'll have so much more to say (say if we ever meet again)  
  
If we ever ever meet again  
I won't let you go away  
  
[Chorus: x2]


I leave the gas on  
Walk the allies in the dark  
Sleep with candles burning  
I leave the door unlocked  
I'm weaving a rope and  
Running all the red lights  
Did I get your attention  
'Cause I'm sending all the signs and  
The clock is ticking  
And I'll be giving my two weeks  
  
Pick your favorite shade of black  
You'd best prepare a speech  
Say something funny  
Say something sweet  
But don't say that you loved me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
But we've been dead for awhile  
This sickness has no cure  
We're goin' down for sure  
Already lost a grip  
Best abandon ship  
  
Maybe I was too pale  
Maybe I was too fat  
Maybe you wanted better, better luck in the sack  
No formal education  
I swear way too much  
I swear you didn't care  
'Cause we were in love  
  
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear  
No, it's all for the better  
That we end this here  
Let's close this chapter  
Say one last prayer  
But don't say that you loved me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm still breathing  
I'm still breathing


This was big for us  
Forever changing you and me  
Allow me to be ambiguous  
Though I can't stand ambiguity  
  
I'll beat around this burning bush  
Trying to put the fire out  
When all the shoving came to push  
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth  
  
Cause it's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your live for someone  
Ba da da dum  
  
It's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
So we might lose  
But I'm glad I didn't leave  
I wear my soul on my shoes  
If not my heart upon my sleeve  
  
If I'm not allowed to speak aloud  
Of what you really mean to me  
Then 'll type it bold when I spell it out  
I.T.S. L.O.V.E.  
  
Cause it's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
Oh Oh Oh  
  
It's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your life for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
Oh  
  
So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break  
Second guess every move that I make  
(Second guess every move that you make)  
  
This was big for us  
Changing you and me  
  
Cause it's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Oh Oh Yeah  
  
Oh it's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your live for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
Oh somebody tell me  
It's okay to believe in something  
It's alright to live your life for someone yeah  
Ba da da dum  
  
Stand up for what you believe in  
Take pride for who you are  
Yeah Yeah  
  
Oh Yeah  
  
Stand up for what you believe in  
Take pride for who you are  
Yeah Yeah  
  
Stand up for what you believe in  
Take pride for who you are  
Yeah Yeah


So when my voice breaks  
It's called interpretation  
When I  
Hold a note  
It's cause I want to...  
Not cause I feel anything about you  
So don't flatter yourself thinking that I  
Love you...  
Make you emotional  
From major to the minor when I  
Lose control  
I'm not trying to impress you  
Break it down  
And I get your attention  
But it's just formula  
Don't need your validation, validation  
  
This is just a song  
The music plays and then  
Then it's gone again  
This is just a song  
The words don't mean a thing  
And everytime I sing  
I loved you all along  
Remember, remember...  
This is just a song  
  
Now I've been nothing  
Yes, I'm on auto-piolit  
Have selfish words  
Even singing while I'm sleeping  
Just cause you have showed up here to see me  
Doesn't mean I'm going home with you this evening


There's a stranger in my bed,  
There's a pounding in my head  
Glitter all over the room  
Pink flamingos in the pool  
I smell like a minibar  
DJ's passed out in the yard  
Barbie's on the barbeque  
This a hickey or a bruise?  
  
( Pre-Chorus )  
Pictures of last night  
Ended up online  
I'm screwed  
Oh well  
It's a blacked out blur  
But I'm pretty sure  
It ruled  
Damn  
  
( Chorus )  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we danced on tabletops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar  
So we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark  
Then had a menage a trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say we're gonna stop op, whoa  
This Friday night  
Do it all again  
This Friday night  
Do it all again  
  
Trying to connect the dots  
Don't know what to tell my boss  
Think the city towed my car  
Chandelier is on the floor  
Ripped my favorite party dress  
Warrants out for my arrest  
Think I need a ginger ale  
That was such an epic fail  
  
( pre-chorus )  
Pictures of last night  
Ended up online  
I'm screwed  
Oh well

Do it all again

I felt it.  
The wire touched my neck and  
Then someone pulled it tighter  
I never saw it coming  
I started to black out and  
Then someone said good morning  
I took it as a warning  
I should have seen it coming  
So now I'll take a chance on  
This thing we may have started  
Intentional or not I  
Don't think we saw it coming  
It's all adding up to something  
That as of some involvement  
That as for our commitment  
I think I see it coming  
If we step out of that limb  
  
My heart beat, beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability  
In all probability  
  
It's a long shot so I say why not  
If I say forget it I no that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if we don't take they're be no chance  
But you're the best I got  
So take the long shot  
  
I realize that there is all this starting  
That we're both scared about but  
We'll never see them coming  
Throw caution to the wind and  
We'll see which way it's blowing  
And to this pulling on  
We'll never see it coming  
Until it's much to close to stop  
  
My heart beat, beats me senselessly  
Why's everything got to be so intense with me  
I'm trying to handle all these unpredictability  
And all probability  
  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it  
I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance  
'Cause I'm the best you got  
So take the long shot  
  
What a pleasant surprise what a breath of fresh air  
You knock the wind out of me  
Blindsided and so unaware  
  
Ahaa, ahaa, ahaa,  
  
Oh I waited for fact to come of fiction  
And you fit my description  
I never saw you coming  
But we'll make it even though  
  
It's a long shot but I say why not  
If I say forget it  
I know that I'll regret it  
It's a long shot just to beat the odds  
The chance is we won't make it  
But I know if I don't take it there's no chance  
'Cause you're the best I got  
So take the long shot  
  
You didn't expect this  
Oh you never saw me coming  
You didn't expect this  
Oh you never saw this coming  
  
I take the long shot  
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot  
'Cause you're the best I got  
  
Oh I'm take this chance on you baby  
I'm take this chance on you baby  
I'm taking this chance


I'm out on my own again  
Face down in the porcelain  
Feeling so high but looking so low  
Party favors on the floor  
Group of girls banging on the door  
So many new fair-weather friends oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you ever been so lost  
Known the way and still so lost  
  
Caught in the eye of a hurricane  
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade  
So sick of this town pulling me down  
My mother says I should come back home but  
Can't find the way cause the way is gone  
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another night waiting for someone to take me home  
Have you ever been so lost  
  
Is there a light  
Is there a light  
At the end of the road  
I'm pushing everyone away  
'Cause I can't feel this anymore  
Can't feel this anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another night waiting for someone to take me home  
Have you ever been so lost  
Have you ever been so lost!


How do I get closer to you  
When you keep it all on mute  
How will I know the right way to love you  
  
Usually the Queen of figurin' out  
Breaking down a man is no work out  
But I have no clue  
How to get through to you  
  
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry  
I keep knockin' on wood, hopin' there's a real boy inside  
  
But you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man  
  
I wish I could just turn you on  
Put a battery in and make you talk  
Even pull a string for you to say anything  
  
But with you there is no guarantee  
Only expired warranty  
A bunch of broken parts  
And I can't seem to find your heart  
  
I'm such a fool  
I'm such a fool  
I'm such a fool  
This one's outta my hands  
I can't put you back together again  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man  
You're just a, a toy  
Could you ever be a real, real boy  
And understand  
But you're not a man  
  
If the past is the problem  
Our future can solve them baby  
I could bring you life if you let me inside baby  
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man


I turn my head  
There's nothing there  
All I own is my thoughts  
For my fears  
I close the door  
To keep out the bad  
I plug my ears  
To keep out these fears  
  
And I cry  
  
So hold me close  
For I'm so tired  
Of holding myself  
So very tired  
And tired  
Tired and tired  
Just hold me  
(Repeat)  
  
I listen to these voices  
Or is it this house  
That's giving me chills,  
As I lie upon  
This little girls bed  
Who's at the door?  
Who's walking near?  
Or has  
My imagination spilled?  
This little girl  
All grown up still fears  
  
Oh and I cry  
  
Chorus(2x)  
  
Where can I go  
Where can I hide  
From these evil sufferings?  
Oh these images  
Painted on my walls  
They say there's a place  
That I can hide  
In the shadow of your wings  
Oh Lord, bring me  
To this place of refuge  
  
No more tears.  
  
Chorus(4x)


Did it seem  
To disappoint you  
Living alone?  
By the banks  
Of your dilemma  
Out of control  
No one seems  
To give the answers  
That you wanna hear  
What you'd give  
To find a welcome here  
  
Miles and miles of lies  
Behind you  
Those were the days  
So many lives  
You'd hope would guide you  
Help you find a way  
Now it seems to your surprise  
That they left you lying here  
What you'd give to dry  
These bitter tears  
  
Did it come naturally?  
You a million miles from home  
When you tried so carefully  
To live a life  
That's not your own  
Always remember  
That it wasn't that long ago  
I stilled the oceans  
I moved the mountains  
To say I love you  
  
Heaven waits  
The hours of silence  
Finds you on your knees  
Broken in a sweet surrender  
Of peace  
All the years of searching  
For a love you didn't know  
Now you've finally found  
A welcome home  
  
Chorus  
  
Music break  
  
Bridge:  
I love you, I have  
And I always will.  
  
Chorus (2x)


[Verse 1:]  
So I ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me, first niggas gotta find me  
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me, can you please remind me  
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy, y'all don't know that don't shit faze me  
The Nets could go 0 for 82 and I'd look at you like this shit gravy  
(Ball so hard) This shit weird, we ain't even spose to be here  
(Ball so hard) Since we here, it's only right that we'd be fair  
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick  
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6  
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock  
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks  
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too  
If you escaped what I've escaped, you'd be in Paris getting fucked up too  
(Ball so hard) Let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days  
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin' Ace on my sick J's  
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye  
Chi town's D. Rose, I'm moving the Nets to BK  
  
[Hook]  
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me  
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
She said, "'Ye can we get married at the mall?"  
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball  
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall  
And show me why you deserve to have it all."  
That shit cray, ain't it Jay? What she order, fish filet?  
Your whip so cold--this old thing?  
Act like you'll ever be around mothafuckas like this again  
Bourgie girl, grab her hand, fuck that bitch she don't wanna dance  
Excuse my French but I'm in France, I'm just sayin'  
Prince Williams ain't do it right if you ask me  
Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley  
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killa?  
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?  
Doctors say I'm the illest, cause I'm suffering from realness  
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh  
  
[Interlude]  
I don't even know what that means  
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)  
No it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone  
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone  
These other niggas is lyin, actin' like the summer ain't mine  
(I got that hot bitch in my home) You know how many hot bitches I own  
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone  
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone  
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling  
I know I'm 'bout to kill it, how you know? I got that feeling  
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone  
Don't let me into my zone (I'm definitely in my zone)


He put it on me, I put it on,  
Like there was nothing wrong  
It didn't fit,  
It wasn't right  
Wasn't just the size  
They say you know,  
When you know  
I don't know  
  
I didn't feel  
The fairytale feeling, no  
Am I a stupid girl  
For even dreaming that I could  
  
If it's not like the movies,  
That's how it should be, yeah  
When he's the one,  
I'll come undone,  
And my world will stop spinning  
And that's just the beginning, yeah  
  
Snow white said when I was young,  
"One day my prince will come"  
So I wait for that date  
They say its hard to meet your match,  
Find my better half  
So we make perfect shapes  
If stars don't align,  
If it doesn't stop time,  
If you cant see the sign,  
Wait for it  
One hundred percent,  
With every penny spent  
He'll be the one that,  
Finishes your sentences  
  
If it's not like the movies,  
That's how it will be  
When he's the one,  
And my world will stop spinning,  
And that's just the beginning  
  
Oh yeah,  
Cause I know you're out there,  
And your, your looking for me  
It's a crazy idea that you were made,  
Perfectly for me you'll see  
  
Just like the movies  
That's how it will be  
Oh but that's how it should be  
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending  
Oh it's not like the movies,  
Oh but that's how it should be  
When he's the one,  
You'll come undone,  
And your world will stop spinning,  
And it's just the beginning


The leaves were falling  
I was seventeen  
We'd been locking lips  
Grabbing hips  
Smoking cigarettes  
We took a drive in your 1990  
Had me down from out of town  
I was California  
Oh my legs were not shaved  
And you had dirt between your fingers  
They told us to behave  
But hey  
  
It's not like riding a bike  
It's not like flying a kite  
It's not as easy as pie  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like taking a bath  
It's not like having a laugh  
It's not like reading a map  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
I had seen it in the  
Magazines  
We would  
Change the chanel  
On the tv screen  
Cuz it's such a sin  
What ya did to me  
Straight to hell it's what they sell  
If you've done the deed  
Oh but what could be so bad  
Oh if everyone is guilty  
I guess we want what we can't have  
'Cause I've heard  
  
It's not like riding a bike  
It's not like flying a kite it's not as easy as pie  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like taking a bath  
It's not like having a laugh  
It's not like reading a map  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
  
La la la la la la  
There's nothing like the first time  
La la la la la la  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
It's not a walk in the park  
It's not a shot in the dark  
It's not a juvenile crime  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like tying the knot  
There's no connecting the dots  
And in case you forgot  
There's nothing like the first time  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
There's nothing like the first time  
Oh oh ohhh  
There's nothing like the first time  
Hey ey ey  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
It's not like reading a map  
Oh I can give you that  
There's nothing like the first time


I saw a spider  
I didn't scream  
'Cause I can belch the alphabet  
Just double dog dare me  
And I chose guitar over ballet  
And I take these suckers down cause they just  
Get in my way  
The way  
You look at me  
Is kinda like a little sister  
You high-five  
Your goodbyes  
And it leaves me nothing but blisters  
  
So I don't want to be one of the boys  
One of your guys  
Just give me a chance  
To prove to you tonight  
I just wanna be one of the girls  
Pretty in pearls  
Not one of the boys  
  
So over summer something changed  
I started reading Seventeen  
And shaving my legs  
And I studied Lolita religiously  
And I walked right in school  
And caught you  
Staring at me  
'Cause I know  
What you know  
But now your gonna' have to take a number  
Its OK  
Maybe one day  
But not until I get my  
Diamond ring  
  
'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys  
One of your guys  
Just give me a chance  
To prove to you tonight  
I just wanna be your homecoming queen  
A pin up poster dream  
Not one of the boys  
  
I wanna be a flower  
Not a dirty weed  
And I wanna smell like roses  
Not a baseball team  
And I swear maybe one day  
Your gonna' wanna' make out make out make out with me  
  
(Don't wanna be)  
Don't want to be  
(Don't wanna be)  
Don't want to be

'Cause I, I don't wanna be one  
One  
One of the boys  
I just wanna be one of the girls  
So pretty in pearls  
Not one of the boys

We can't keep playing house  
With such a big world outside  
How do we shut it out?  
At a fork in the road  
Should I stay or should I go?  
I'll keep the cat  
Leave a spare under the mat  
If you need to crash one day  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Don't you think we're just too young  
To play these grown up games?  
  
Cause you know me too well  
It'd be like me lying to myself  
But I'm so scared to be alone  
And go back to sleeping with the lights on  
  
Cause I can be myself  
Drunk or sober fat proactive poster  
Wouldn't it be nice  
If we were older  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Don't you think we're just too young  
To play these grown up games  
  
Some days I wanna take my chances  
Not live so modernized  
Some day I wanna be a Mrs.  
But it's not yet quite right  
No it's not yet quite right  
  
So there go our future children's names  
I put the rest of us in a box in the closet  
That I cannot open without getting full  
Full of emotion  
Because you know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
You know I loved you  
  
Cause I know we swore forever  
But it seems so far away  
Don't you think we're just too young  
To play  
  
One day I wanna take my chances  
Not live so modernized  
One day I wanna be a Mrs.  
But it's not yet quite right  
No it's not yet quite right  
No it's not yet quite right


Twelve noon  
Watch her sleeping in your room  
Why can't that still be me  
Two o'clock and I'm still driving round your block  
Feeling a little  
Crazy  
  
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you can't hide  
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising is that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
So weeks pass and I found myself another guy  
Someone who loves me equally, yeah  
The tables turn and you're not happy  
When you learn he's moving in with me  
He bought me a big ring we moved to the city  
Now you won't stop calling  
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B  
Now your showing  
Up at my place  
Not surprising  
We both play this game  
  
You're underneath my street light  
Blowing kisses every night  
  
Psycho love forever  
You're right outside my window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
La la la la  
La la la la  
Forever  
La la la la  
La la la la  
  
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you can't hide  
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love


I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath  
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess  
So I sat quietly, agree politely  
I guess that I forgot I had a choice  
I let you push me past the breaking point  
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything  
  
You held me down, but I got up  
Already brushing off the dust  
You hear my voice, your hear that sound  
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground  
You held me down, but I got up  
Get ready 'cause I had enough  
I see it all, I see it now  
  
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar  
Louder, louder than a lion  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Now I'm floating like a butterfly  
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes  
I went from zero, to my own hero  
  
You held me down, but I got up (hey! )  
Already brushing off the dust  
You hear my voice, your hear that sound  
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground  
You held me down, but I got up  
Get ready 'cause I've had enough  
I see it all, I see it now  
  
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar  
Louder, louder than a lion  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar!  
  
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar  
Louder, louder than a lion  
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're gonna hear me roar!  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You're gonna hear me roar!


I kissed your sweet lips  
I floated so high  
Your eyes looked at mine  
The world froze in time  
What is this feeling?  
I am on cloud nine  
Guess  
I'm still reeling  
From your body  
Next to mine  
  
It's a rush  
I can't explain  
Like you shot  
Something crazy  
Into my veins  
And I'm ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I don't want  
To come down  
Don't want  
To come down  
  
I know  
You're sleeping  
I wish you  
Were right here  
'Cause my bed's so empty  
I'd hold you so close dear  
And I sang my song to you  
Your smile was priceless  
What else can I do?  
  
I'm a junkie over you  
  
It's a rush  
I can't explain  
Like you shot something  
Crazy into my veins  
And I'm ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I don't want  
To come down  
  
Is it me  
Or is everything spinning  
I'm wide awake  
But I must be dreaming  
It's like  
You're some kind of drug  
Try to catch my breath  
And see  
If I'm still breathing  
Touch my heart  
And make sure  
It's beating  
It's like  
I'm falling in love  
  
It's a rush  
I can't explain  
Like you shot  
Something crazy  
Into my veins  
And I'm ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I don't  
No I don't  
No  
Don't want  
To come down  
Don't want  
To come down  
Gonna come down


Through this skin you see  
My heart  
Through this laughter you feel  
My pain  
Even through this mask you see  
My face  
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am  
And you search me  
And you know all the secrets of my heart  
And you search me  
Revealing the mysteries of who You are  
You search me  
Growing up never comes  
Easily  
In Your hands, You're the potter  
Molding me  
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game  
Of hide and seek  
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am  
CHORUS  
My Father, my Father  
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child  
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight  
CHORUS


Remember when I dove  
Into the crowd  
And I got a bloody knee  
Under my skin  
A mark from wiping out  
It brings back the memories  
Every bone's been broken  
And my heart is still wide open  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stop  
Don't care if I lose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
I'm going down in flames for you  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
One more thing I'm addicted too  
  
With each scar there's a map  
That tells a story  
What a souvenir of Young  
Love's like jumping out  
An airplane riding a tidal  
Wave on an ocean of emotion  
My heart rips me wide open  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I cover up these scars  
(We'll make it we'll make it  
But we break it)  
And I can't stop seeing stars  
(Lets hope not die)  
Whenever you're around  
Around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't stop no I can't stop  
No I can't stop  
Oh I'm going out in flames  
Oh I'm going down in flames  
Oh  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose


Lay me down at your altar, baby  
I'm a slave to this luck  
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales  
  
I have prayed for a power like you  
To see deep down in my soul  
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road  
  
Magic, or one, or mystery  
All of you trying to work on me  
I would surrender myself  
Holy hell, and heaven high  
You will open up my eyes  
And I'm finally here  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
Love you crazy kite on your left  
Lost in sweet ecstasy  
Found a nirvana finally  
  
Magic, or one, or mystery  
All of you trying to work on me  
I would surrender myself  
Holy hell, and heaven high  
You will open up my eyes  
And I am finally here  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
(You make me float, you make me float)  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
So phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
(You make me float, oh, you make me float)


What are you lookin' at?  
(Yeah)  
  
I saw this coming  
From a mile away  
I saw a crack  
In the egg  
A little rip  
In the page  
  
I found  
Your necklace  
On the floor  
Underneath the bed  
Where you said  
I was the only one  
  
You thought I'd cry  
(You-thought-i'd-cry)  
You thought I'd lay  
Down and die  
You thought  
There's no  
Hetting over you  
(Ha-ha)  
  
And all this time  
(All-this-time)  
You've been having  
Your fun  
I've been having  
Some fun too  
  
Cause' it  
Takes one to know one  
Congrats  
You've met your match  
You think I'd lie here  
Heartbroken  
But the knife  
Is in your back  
(In-your-back)  
  
You left your suit  
You left your tie  
And looked me in the eye  
And swore that it  
Was business baby  
(Yeah right)  
  
And when you left  
I got a call  
That started it all  
And now  
It's not your business  
Ba-by  
  
You thought I'd cry  
(You-thought-i'd-cry)  
You thought I'd lay  
Down and die  
You thought  
There's no  
Getting over you  
(Ha-ha)  
  
But all this time  
(All-this-time)  
You've been having  
Your fun  
I've been having  
Some fun too  
  
Cause' it  
Takes one to know one  
Congrats  
You've met your match  
You think I'd lie here  
Heartbroken  
(I'd-lie-here)  
But the knife  
Is in your back  
(In-your-back)  
  
You're such a wreck  
The cutest accident  
Makes so much sense  
You'll come  
Back to me  
Oh  
(Ahhhh)  
  
And I'll let you  
  
Hey  
Huh  
You're back  
  
Cause' it takes one  
To know one  
Congrats  
You've met your match  
You think  
I'd lie here  
Heartbroken  
(I'd-lie-here)  
But the knife  
Is in you're back  
(In-your-back)  
  
Cause' it  
Takes one to know one  
(Hi, nice to meet you)  
Congrats

I'd lie here  
Heartbroken  
(I'll-lie-here)  
But the knife  
Is in your back  
(In-your-back)


You think I'm pretty  
Without any make-up on  
You think I'm funny  
When I tell the punch line wrong  
I know you get me  
So I'll let my walls come down, down  
  
Before you met me  
I was alright but things were kinda heavy  
You brought me to life now every February  
You'll be my valentine, valentine  
  
Let's go all the way tonight  
No regrets, just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I  
We'll be young forever  
  
You make me  
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream  
The way you turn me on  
I, can't, sleep  
Let's runaway And don't ever look back  
Don't ever look back  
  
My, heart, stops when you look at me  
Just, one, touch  
Now baby I believe this, is, real  
So take a chance and don't ever look back  
Don't ever look back  
  
We drove to Cali  
And got drunk on the beach  
Got a motel and  
Built a fort out of sheets  
I finally found you  
My missing puzzle piece  
I'm complete  
  
Let's go all the way tonight  
No regrets, just love  
We can dance until we die  
You and I  
We'll be young forever  
  
You make me  
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream  
The way you turn me on  
I, can't, sleep  
Let's runaway And don't ever look back

My, heart, stops when you look at me  
Just, one, touch  
Now baby I believe this, is, real  
So take a chance and don't ever look back  
Don't ever look back  
  
I'm a get your heart racing  
In my skin-tight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight  
  
Let you put your hands on me  
In my skin-tight jeans  
Be a teenage dream tonight

You make me  
Feel like I'm living a, teenage dream

I took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal  
When you had enough of it  
I said fine good luck replacing this  
Cause I seem strong and independent self sufficient, confident  
And I'm like mercury rising to the top so selfishly  
  
The better half of me was you  
I'm like a hive without a bee without you  
I gotta find ya gotta, remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
So please accept my apology cause I'm feeling  
Like a branch without it's tree  
It took me a fall to really see  
That your the catch I wanna keep  
  
'Cause I get weak thinking about you  
Living without you life has no value  
Baby come back to me  
'Cause you're the only missing piece  
  
'Cause the better half of me was you  
I'm like the hive without it's bee without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
That two is better than one  
  
Ooh it took a little earthquake  
To appreciate the stability you've given me  
So consistently  
  
The better half of me was you  
I'm like a bird without it's wings without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
That two is stronger than one  
  
The better half of me, oh it's you  
I'm like a heart without it's beat without you  
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya  
I promise you that I'm gotta try to  
I'm gonna love ya cause two is better than one


Got a call from my friend  
She saw my picture again  
In a magazine  
We laughed out loud  
'Cuz she said "remeber when...  
This was all a silly dream?  
Now I wake up every day  
In a different city  
A smile on my face  
Somebody pinch me  
She said "all the world's a satge"  
But girl you know  
Those cameras and lights  
Won't ever change me  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
  
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along  
Hear the radio playin' my song  
I still get butterflies  
Still get nervous inside  
In the spotlight  
  
Now every now n then  
On a friday night  
Cruisin' down to the dive bar  
We waste the night away  
Spend saturday sleepin' in late  
Those were the good days  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
  
And even when I'm miles away  
I'll always have the roots from where I came  
Cuz when it all fades away  
My home will still be the same  
  
Yeah eh  
Yeah...  
  
I don't drink champagne  
When I'm back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door


Summer after high school, when we first met  
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead  
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos  
  
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof  
Talk about our future like we had a clue  
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
In another life, I would be your girl  
We keep all our promises, be us against the world  
In another life, I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away  
The one that got away  
  
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash  
Never one without the other, we made a pact  
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa  
  
Someone said you had your tattoo removed  
Saw you downtown, singing the blues  
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The one, the one, the one  
The one that got away  
  
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no  
Can't replace you with a million rings, no  
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa  
Cause now I pay the price  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The one (the one)  
The one (the one)  
The one (the one)  
  
In another life, I would make you stay  
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away  
The one that got away


The owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful  
Pea green boat they took some honey and plenty of money  
Wrapped up in a five pound note.  
The owl looked up to the stars above,  
And sang from a small guitar,  
Oh lovely pussy oh pussy my love,  
What a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful  
Pussy you are. So they sailed away for a year and a  
Day to the land where the palm trees grow,  
And there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on  
The end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his  
Nose. Dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling  
Your ring? Said the piggy I will.  
So they took it away and were married nest day by the  
Turkey who lived on the hill.  
The dined on mince and slices of quince which they  
Ate with an runcible spoon and hand in hand by the  
Edge of the sand they dance in the light of the moon  
The moon they danced in the light of the moon.


I've played the song,  
Now it drives me crazy  
I've run the race  
Now I'm too damn lazy  
This love of ours  
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah  
Now I must approach to life today,  
Seems a little different,  
Hard to say,  
But it looks like the end.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
We've surfed the wave  
Now we've hit the short end  
We've squeezed the fruit  
Till there's no more juice left.  
We're both so good  
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah  
Hey but no one's got to die  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
As I'm waving you goodbye  
I want you to smile  
Save a picture in your frame  
File it right next to my name  
I'm willing to die  
For love willing to try  
But not willing to lie for love  
I know that this cakes already baked  
Now it's burning burning.  
  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut,  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Times up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah  
Even when it's gone.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I get enough,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone


I hope you hang yourself with your stupid scarf  
While jacking off listening to Mozart  
You mean and moan about L. A.  
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway  
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars  
You're so indie rock it's almost an art  
You need money  
Just to stay alive  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
  
You're so mad maybe you should buy a big mac  
You're so skinny you should really super size the deal  
Secretly you you're so amused  
And nobody understands you  
I'm so mean cuz cannot get you out of your head  
I'm so angry cuz you'd rather my space instead  
I can't believe I fell in love  
With someone that wears more make up and  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like

You're so stupid, you're so stupid  
  
You walking around like you're oh so debonair  
You pull them down and there's really nothing there  
I wish you would just be real with me  
  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like boys  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like  
You're so stupid and you don't even like boys  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no you don't even like...  
Boys.  
No you don't even like, no you don't even like, no, no, no, no, no, no


You gotta help me out  
It's all a blur last night  
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke  
I lost my fake id but you lost the motel key  
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks  
Now don't blame me  
You roll the cash out  
And get the hell out of town  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Why are these lights so bright  
Oh, did we get hitched last night, dressed up like Elvis,  
Why, am I wearing your class ring?  
Don't call your mother  
Cause now we're partners in crime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You got me into this  
Information overload, situation lost control  
Send out an S.O.S.  
And get some cash out  
We're gonna tear up the town  
  
Don't be a baby  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Remember what you told me  
Told me, you told me, you told me  
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
  
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now  
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas  
That's what you get baby, shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter  
Give me some cash out, baby  
Give me some cash out, baby


Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
  
You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy  
Yeah, you take me to utopia  
You're reading me like erotica,  
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah  
  
Just when I think I can't take anymore  
We go deeper and harder than ever before  
We go higher and higher  
I feel like I'm already there  
  
I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air  
  
This is pure paradise,  
Even heaven is jealous of our love  
Yes, we make angels cry,  
Raining down on earth from up above  
  
Just when I think I can't take anymore  
We go deeper and harder than ever before  
We go higher and higher  
I feel like I'm already there  
  
I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)  
I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
  
Heaven is jealous of our love  
Angels are crying from up above  
  
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air  
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air  
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air  
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air  
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air  
  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air  
I'm walking on air


I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake  
  
I'm wide awake  
Yeah, I was in the dark  
I was falling hard  
With an open heart  
I'm wide awake  
How did I read the stars so wrong  
  
I'm wide awake  
And now it's clear to me  
That everything you see  
Ain't always what it seems  
I'm wide awake  
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long  
  
I wish I knew then  
What I know now  
Wouldn't dive in  
Wouldn't bow down  
Gravity hurts  
You made it so sweet  
Till I woke up on  
On the concrete  
  
[Chorus]  
Falling from cloud nine  
Crashing from the high  
I'm letting go tonight  
I'm falling from cloud to night,  
  
I'm wide awake  
Not losing any sleep  
Picked up every piece  
And landed on my feet  
I'm wide awake  
Need nothing to complete myself, no  
  
I'm wide awake  
Yeah, I am born again  
Out of the lion's den  
I don't have to pretend  
And it's too late  
The story's over now, the end  
  
I wish I knew then  
What I know now  
Wouldn't dive in  
Wouldn't bow down  
Gravity hurts  
You made it so sweet  
Till I woke up on  
On the concrete  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thunder rumbling  
Castles crumbling  
I am trying to hold on  
God knows that I tried  
Seeing the bright side  
But I'm not blind anymore  
I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake  
I'm wide awake


Get used to it, Katy  
Everyone trashes you under the table  
As they're smiling at your face  
Cruel words like a stun gun  
Life can be hum drum  
Knock to the ground, oh  
  
But if you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know it's working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care, would you care  
  
Get used to it, Katy  
People's attention  
Sure is focused on you  
Your the subject of the day  
They need something to speak about  
No need to freak out  
Tomorrow is over  
Today you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know it's working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
  
Mean worlds, mean words, mean thoughts, meanwhile  
Don't let it get to you  
Girl, don't cry  
They lie  
Don't let it get to you  
Get used to it  
  
Nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care, would you care


Everything comes around again  
The circus returns to town again  
Oh, no oh, yeah  
Now you are at my door again  
Crawling around my floor again, oh yeah  
  
'Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didn't miss me when  
I was all alone your back 'cause you know  
I can't help but love you  
I can't help but kiss you  
I can't help but let you in  
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
  
Everything comes around again  
What goes up will come down again  
Oh, no oh, yes  
Wearing your old white dress again  
Making my head a mess again  
  
'Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didn't miss me when  
I was all alone your back 'cause you know  
I can't help but love you  
  
I can't help but kiss you  
I can't help but let you in  
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
'Cause the love has gone  
And your on your own  
'Cause you missed me la la la la  
You just press rewind we go back in time  
  
'Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didn't miss me when  
I was all alone your back caz you know  
I can't help but love you  
I can't help but kiss you  
I can't help but let you in  
I'm off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
  
Can't help but love you  
I can't help but kiss you  
I can't help but let you in  
You miss me you miss me  
Your love has gone and your all alone  
You miss me you miss me
