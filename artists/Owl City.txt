The bird is here and we are off  
To wherever those wings take us  
The atmosphere is crawling with airlines  
That wind through the clouds  
And look down at the crowds  
Relax your back and let the noise  
Sing you to sleep in my arms  
If you awake before we arrive  
I will carry you down and I won?t make a sound  
  
The scent is strong as we move on  
And breathe in the pristine crime scene  
The false veneer is old like a sub stick to volunteer  
From oh some other year  
I'm just a shell as far as I can tell  
So I paint my eyes a light green  
The silver beams are twirling and swirling  
Throughout your dreams  
Like air traffic streams


When I'm dressed to the nines, I'm just a shirt and tie  
With a taste for prestige, and beautiful mystery.  
But, clever girls dressed to kill are pretty bittersweet,  
And better-suited for grief than beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
She enjoys it the most, with flowers in her hair.  
Dressin' up like a ghost for beautiful mystery.  
So I kiss her goodnight, and stumble from the room.  
Mighty high on mystique, and beautiful mystery.  
  
Oh, beautiful mystery.  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die!  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Fly by, feather.  
This time, I'm not ready to die.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)  
  
Now or never.  
Stand back, 'cause I'm ready to fly.  
But I lose myself.  
(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!)


So I walk alone down the darkest roads  
'Cause I've always known how the story goes  
When the curtain falls, I'll be wearing thin  
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in  
In this twisted plot I was destined for  
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor  
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end  
How I wish I could do it all again  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
It's another night of the living dead  
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb  
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway  
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey  
I would run and hide for the afternoon  
With the butterfly in the panic room  
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time  
For a different twist in the story line  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
Tell the world I know that my mind is made  
It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid  
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time  
For a different twist in the story line


I regarded the world as such a sad sight  
Until I viewed it in black and white  
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape  
And sealed the exits with caution tape  
Don?t refocus your eyes in the darkness  
And don?t remember this place unless  
I describe all the things that you cannot see  
And we?ll unravel the mystery  
  
Farewell all my friends in textbooks, ?cuz I?m going home  
?Cuz my blood cells cannot depend on the weather in photographs  
There?s a light show out my window, somewhere way up there  
Dear Vienna, are you singing?  
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?  
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away  
  
I regarded the world as such a sad sight  
Until I viewed it in black and white  
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape  
And sealed the exits with caution tape  
Don?t refocus your eyes in the darkness  
And don?t remember this place unless  
I describe all the things that you cannot see  
And we?ll unravel the mystery  
  
I was so far out of place  
Watching those stars in outer space  
'cause I am so far from where you are  
  
There?s a light show out my window, somewhere way up there  
Dear Vienna, are you singing?  
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?  
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away


Met a girl in the parking lot,  
And all I did was say hello.  
Her pepper spray made it rather hard  
For me to walk her home,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me again was it love at first sight  
When I walked by and you caught my eye.  
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?  
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.  
  
Met a girl with a graceful charm,  
But when beauty met the beast he froze.  
Got the sense I was not her type  
By a black eye and bloody nose,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's suffocating to say,  
But the female mystique takes my breath away.  
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,  
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me again was it love at first sight  
When I walked by and you caught my eye.  
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?  
If life was a game, you would never play nice.  
If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.  
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.  
  
You're the deer in the headlights.  
You're the deer in the headlights.


I brush my teeth and look in the mirror,  
And laugh out loud,  
As I'm beaming from ear to ear,  
I'd rather pick flowers instead of fights,  
And rather than flaunt my style I'd flash you a smile  
Of clean pearly whites.  
  
I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill,  
I smooth my hair,  
Sit back in the chair  
But somehow I still get the chills  
  
Have a seat he says pleasantly,  
As he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me,  
"Open up nice and wide" he says peering in,  
And with a smirk he says "don't have a fit,  
This will just pinch a bit"  
As he tries not to grin.  
  
When hygienists  
Leave on long vacations  
That's when dentists scream and  
Lose their patience  
  
Talking only brings the toothaches on because  
I say the stupidest things  
So if my results go south, I swallow my pride with an aspirin and shut my
mouth  
  
Golf and alcohol don't mix  
And that's why I don't drink and drive  
Because good grief  
I'd knock out my teeth  
And have to kiss my smile goodbye  
  
I've been to the dentist a thousand times  
So I know the drill,  
I smooth my hair,  
Sit back in the chair  
But some how I still get the chills


You would not believe your eyes  
If ten million fireflies  
Lit up the world as I fell asleep  
  
'Cause they fill the open air  
And leave teardrops everywhere  
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare  
  
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems  
  
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs  
From ten thousand lightning bugs  
As they tried to teach me how to dance  
  
A foxtrot above my head  
A sock hop beneath my bed  
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)  
  
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)  
  
Leave my door open just a crack  
Please take me away from here  
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac  
Please take me away from here  
Why do I tire of counting sheep  
Please take me away from here  
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep  
  
To ten million fireflies  
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes  
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (said farewell)  
  
But I'll know where several are  
If my dreams get real bizarre  
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar)  
  
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)  
  
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)  
  
(I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly)  
(It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep)  
(Because my dreams are bursting at the seams)


Call back the cap-com,  
Tick off the time-bomb  
Let felicity fly  
Armour the airlock  
Blanket the bedrock  
And kiss the planet goodbye  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far  
  
Fight back the flight deck  
Bring on the breakneck  
Cue the solar eclipse  
Summit the sunset  
Dovetail the dragnet  
And blow your backbone to bits  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far  
  
Oh telescope  
Keep an eye on my only hope  
Lest I blink and be swept off the narrow road  
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me  
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need  
  
For He is the saving grace  
Of the Galaxies  
He is the saving grace  
Of the Galaxies  
  
Dear God, I was terribly lost  
When the galaxies crossed  
And the Sun went dark  
But dear God, You're the only North Star  
I would follow this far

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer  
In the hills and highlands  
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots  
And awake in your mouth  
  
Hello Seattle, I am a manta-ray  
Deep beneath the blue waves  
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound  
And construct my summer home  
  
Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon  
Shining down on your face  
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill  
And descend inside of you  
  
Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse  
Feeling warm in your sand  
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf  
Rolling in the evening breeze  
  
Hello Seattle, I am an albatross  
On the docks and your boats  
I sail above your inlets and interstates  
Through the rain and open wind  
  
Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse  
Throwing beams of bright lights  
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun  
Taking heed from everyone  
  
Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer  
In the hills and highlands  
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots  
  
Take me above your light  
Carry me through the night  
Hold me secure in flight  
Sing me to sleep tonight  
  
Take me above your light  
Carry me through the night  
Hold me secure in flight  
Sing me to sleep tonight


If we could sit together a moment  
And talk forever just to pass the time  
I would smile as the shivers and chills  
Run down my spine  
And your eyes are locked on mine  
Oh, we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
And when you close your tired eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
  
Deep inside of you  
There's a ruby glow  
And it gets brighter  
Than you and I will ever know  
There's a rushing sound  
That surrounds us  
When we walk alone  
And it's everything we've never known  
  
(Wonder down the street and I will be the pavement beneath your feet)  
  
If we could just be immobile for some time  
And finally figure out the way we feel  
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks  
That still look a bit surreal  
Oh, I tend to disappear  
Here and there  
So concentrate and you'll feel me  
Everywhere  
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air  
If you're lost when you close your eyes  
I'll meet you there  
  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
I'll meet you there  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
I'll meet you there


[Verse 1]  
In Christ alone, my hope is found  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This cornerstone, this solid ground  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm  
[Chorus]  
What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, and when strivings cease  
My comforter, my all-in-all  
Here in the love of Christ I stand  
[Verse 2]  
There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious day  
Up from the grave He rose again  
[Chorus]  
And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ  
[Verse 3]  
No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny  
[Chorus]  
No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
[Outro]  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand


Well it's Christmas time, and I'm warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
Cause you're here with me, and I guarantee  
My heart is yours to hold  
So we smile below this mistletoe as if we need a hint  
And the falling snow, well I bet it knows  
How love can pull you in  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fly around the world tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Can't fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Well, it's Christmas time, and I'm warm inside  
Despite the bitter cold  
And it's crystal clear that this Christmas cheer  
Is healthy for the soul  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Glowing by the fireside  
Leave the presents on the floor  
Cause you're the one I'm waiting for  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's fly around the world tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time  
Little lights flash in your eyes  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Can't fight the way I feel inside  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
Oh, let me lead the way this Holiday  
  
Let's fly around the word tonight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe it's Christmas time  
I love the way you hold me tight, oh yeah  
Kiss me babe, it's Christmas time


Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky  
And we'll stir the stars around and watch them fall away  
Into the Hudson Bay and plummet out of sight and sound  
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills  
Where I live in the Alpine heights  
Below the northern lights I spend my coldest nights alone awake  
And thinking of the weekend we were in love  
(The weekend we were in love)  
Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull  
A thousand miles from the tide  
Put photos on the walls of New York shopping malls  
Distract me so I stay inside  
I wish the rocket stayed over the promenade 'cause I would make a hook  
And I can fish them from the sky  
My darling she and I, we're hanging on so take us high  
To sing the world goodbye  
I am floating away lost in a silent ballet  
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
My darling we're both on the wing  
Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head  
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone  
I am floating away  
(Floating away)  
Lost in a silent ballet  
(Silent ballet)  
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
(Early parades)  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
(Noisy arcades)  
My darling we're both on the wing look down and keep on singing  
And we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
Are you there  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)  
(Are you there)


Just before the dawn,  
When the light's still gone,  
Shine, shine your way,  
And you may not know, where to go,  
Shine, shine your way  
  
Open road but it's still dark,  
Build a fire from a spark,  
And shine, shine your way,  
Feed the feeling in your heart,  
Don't conceal it then you'll start,  
To find, find your way  
  
No one can stop, what has begun,  
You must believe when I say  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,  
Starting today,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine your way  
  
There's an open sky,  
And a reason why,  
You shine, shine your way,  
There's so much to learn,  
And now it's your turn,  
To shine, shine your way  
  
There's a feeling deep inside,  
You can let it be your guide,  
To find, find your way,  
And there's no time for us to waste,  
Got to take a leap of faith,  
And fly, fly away  
  
Don't have to walk,  
Now you can run,  
Nothing can get in your way  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,  
Starting today,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine your way  
  
Morning is breaking,  
Darkness is fading,  
We found a way to the light,  
It's such a beautiful sight  
  
Any time, anywhere,  
Turn around and I'll be there,  
To shine, shine your way  
  
Like a star burning bright,  
Lighting up the darkest night,  
I'll shine, shine your way  
  
Now I can see,  
You are the one,  
Sent here to show me the way  
  
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,  
Starting today,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
We're on our way,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
That's what we say,  
Shine, shine, shine,  
Shine your way  
  
There's a reason why  
You shine, shine your way  
  
All of our tears will dry faster in the sun  
Shine your way


I tried to disappear  
But your the only reason I'm floating here  
Eyes painted crystal clear  
I can see our future through the atmosphere  
  
Don't you go, no, don't you go  
Don't you know I'm up here alone  
Yeah, I am like a satellite  
Sending you a signal tonight  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
You were so hard to find  
With oh, so many clouds across my summer sky  
You, my constellation prize  
Yeah, every single star is sparkling in your eyes  
  
So, don't you go, no, don't you go  
'Cause don't you know I'm up here alone  
So high, like a satellite  
I'm sending you a signal tonight  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
(One track, one mind, one race to win)  
(One start, one heart, one life to live)  
(One track, one mind, one race to win)  
(One start, one heart, one life to live)  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love


This is a world of dreams and reverie  
Where I felt the stars explode around me  
A grass-blade flashed with a gleam  
As it slashed open a moon-beam  
And I stared back breathlessly  
As mountains of fruit tumbled out  
I barely had the chance to shout  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Staying awake that night was rather hard  
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard  
When we woke up buried alive  
Beneath a fruity landslide  
We both laughed hysterically  
It could have been just another dream  
But I swear I heard you scream  
A strawberry avalanche crashed over me  
  
Always a citrus constellation in the galaxy  
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids  
And I've been dying to see  
If you were a beautiful sound  
In the echoes all around  
Then I'd be your harmony  
And we'd sing along with the crowds  
Beneath the candy-coated clouds  
A strawberry avalanche, please crash over me  
  
This is a world of dreams and reverie  
Where I felt the stars explode around me


Glamor and fashion  
Models and magazines  
A striking runway entrance  
Beauty and passion  
Stardust and high class scenes  
Of popular teens  
When I lived in Denver  
I met a millionaire  
With ribbons in her blond hair  
I still remember  
She was like a princess  
Straight from a dreamy castle in the air  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
Both alone in the dark  
We longed to see the sun  
Rise over the Bering Strait  
I was sick of the west  
When I turned 21  
So I moved to the Sunshine State  
We played golf on the moon  
And tennis on the sun  
Like athletes in the afternoon  
The solar flares burned my arms  
And made her make-up run  
On our super-lunar honeymoon  
  
I was the youngest son of a congressman  
And everything was my fault  
She was a gymnast  
Happily swinging on the uneven bars  
Tucked in a somersault  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
Both alone in the dark  
We longed to see the sun  
Rise over the Bering Strait  
I was sick of the west  
When I turned 21  
So I moved to the Sunshine State  
We played golf on the moon  
And tennis on the sun  
Like athletes in the afternoon  
The solar flares burned my arms  
And made her make-up run  
On our super-lunar honeymoon


If you're the bird,  
Whenever we pretend it's summer,  
Then I'm the worm,  
I know the part, it's such a bummer,  
But fair is fair,  
If my segments get separated,  
I'll scream  
And you'll be there.  
  
Close your eyes (close my eyes),  
(so I cotton off of your shoulder)  
And feel the shine (feel the shine),  
I'm hooked so toss me over,  
And cast a line (oh I'll try),  
Oh throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends),  
As they arrive (if they arrive),  
  
You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind),  
But I still have just one more question on my mind,  
For all my pals who live in all the oceans and the seas,  
With friends like these well, who needs enemies?  
  
Da dat dah da da da da da da dat dah  
  
If I'm your boy,  
Let's take a short cut we remember,  
And we'll enjoy,  
Pickin' apples in late September  
Like we've done for years,  
Then we'll take a long walk through the corn field,  
And I'll kiss you, between the ears,  
  
If you're my girl,  
Swirl me around your room with feeling,  
And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling,  
Will shine for us,  
As love sweeps over the room,  
Cause we tend to make each other blush (you make me blush)  
  
You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind),  
But I still have just one more question on my mind,  
For all my pals who live in all the oceans and the seas,  
With fronds like these well, who needs anemones?  
  
You're the bird and I'm the worm,  
And it's plain to see that we were meant to be  
We were meant to be  
  
Da dat dah da da da da da da dat dah  
  
If you're the bird  
If you're the bird  
Then I'm the worm  
We were meant to be


I am the red in the rose, the flowers  
On the blankets on your bedroom floor.  
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides  
With your clothes behind your closet door.  
  
I am the green in the grass that bends back  
From underneath your feet.  
And I am the blue in your back alley view  
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet.  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars.  
You can go anywhere you wish cause I'll be there, wherever you are.  
(Wherever you are) [Repeat x2]  
  
(I will always be your gaze  
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase)  
  
I am the black in the book  
The letters on the pages that you memorize.  
And I am the orange in the overcast  
Of color that you visualize.  
  
I am the white in the walls that soak up  
All the sound when you cannot sleep.  
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach  
That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars. (my darling)  
You can go anywhere you wish cause I'll be there, wherever you are. (My
darling)  
  
(Wherever you are) [Repeat x3]


Shipwreck in a sea of faces  
There's a dreamy world up there  
Dear friends in higher places  
Carry me away from here  
  
Travel light, let the sun eclipse you  
'Cause your flight is about to leave  
And there's more to this brave adventure  
Than you'd ever believe  
  
Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery  
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)  
  
On the heels of war and wonder  
There's a stormy world up there  
You can't whisper above the thunder  
But you can fly anywhere  
  
Purple burst of paper birds  
This picture paints a thousand words  
So take a breath of myth and mystery  
And don't look back  
  
Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery  
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)  
  
There's a realm above the trees  
Where the lost are finally found  
Touch your feathers to the breeze  
And leave the ground  
  
Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery  
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky  
(You take to the sky)  
(You take to the sky)


It's unbelievable  
This is as good as it gets  
It's unbelievable  
Don't know what's gonna happen next  
It's unbelievable

It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable  
  
When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO  
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus  
When I was a kid I ate Spaghetti-Os, played laser tag and G.I. Joes  
And if you vowed "no girls allowed, " then you could join the club  
When I was a kid I spent my Saturdays  
Blowin' on Nintendo games  
The newest thing was "Lion King, " and I could feel the love  
  
It's unbelievable

[Hanson:]  
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels  
Stayed up late watching action films  
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit  
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, ate Dr. Pepper jellybeans  
My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" was how real the raptors looked  
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff  
Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, and it was off the hook!  
  
It's unbelievable  
This is as good as it gets  
It's unbelievable  
Don't know what's gonna happen next

Grape Juicy Juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and  
Slip 'N Slides, McDonald's fries, those were the best  
What happens next?

Are you out there  
Where the rainy days begin  
To feel rather sad  
And the walls are closing in  
Like the darkness around me  
It's so hard to look away  
When the daylight doesn't ever stay  
Above this dull apartment view  
Oh, I will surround you  
  
It's quite clear that I'm stuck here  
So I'll devise a plan  
And cut out a door in my new living room floor  
The porch light is so bright  
That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape  
Of the rusty fire escape  
  
I bought a one way ticket  
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground  
Unless I was aboard a jet plane  
And we were going down  
When I wiped the tears from my eyes  
The warm water took me by surprise  
And I woke up beside the ocean  
I realized I must be in California  
  
Aloha, my happy West Coast friends  
Do you feel alive  
When the breaking waves arrive  
And wash all around you  
The beach homes and ocean side  
Are quite well known by the evening tide  
And we can sleep where we reside  
With redwoods around us  
The blue air is up there  
And could I bring it down  
I'd bottle it up, and save it for a sweet summer night  
  
I bought a one way ticket  
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground  
Unless I was aboard a jet plane  
And we were going down  
When I wiped the tears from my eyes  
The warm water took me by surprise  
And I woke up beside the ocean  
I realized I must be in California  
I must be in California  
  
Am I awake or is this just a dream'  
  
The new year is out here  
And I will make a lovely list  
Of your charms  
So I'll never feel alone in your arms  
  
I must be in California  
I must be in California  
I must be in California


Wake me if you're out there  
Through the glass in my bedroom window,  
In the bushes far below,  
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow,  
  
Among the ones I so clearly know.  
I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged,  
With a note on the rocking chair,  
That says I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,  
  
So wake me if you're out there.  
Living close to the ground,  
It's seventh heaven because there are angels all around,  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.  
So wake me if you're out there  
Wake me if you're out there  
In the dust on my cellar staircase,  
  
A pair of footprints followed me,  
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace,  
Blinked again, but there was nothing to see.  
I've been leaving all the windows unlocked,  
  
With a basket by the oak tree,  
'Cause I'll be picking up the acorns that fall off,  
If you'll be climbing up to meet me.  
Living close to the ground!  
  
It's seventh heaven because there are angels all around,  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.  
So wake me if you're out there!  
  
I keep my knees black and blue 'cause they often hit the hardwood floor,  
(Wake me if you're out there),  
And I believe, so I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore,  
I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged,  
  
With a note on the rocking chair that says I'm dreaming of the life I once
loved,  
So wake me if you're out there.  
Living close to the ground!  
It's seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around,  
  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts  
The indications reveal,  
(Wake me if you're out there),  
  
That few of us realize life is quite so real,  
So if you're dying to see,  
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity  
So if you're dying to see,  
  
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity


A spark soaring down through the pouring rain  
And restoring life to the lighthouse  
A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs  
My emotion up like a rain cloud  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
  
A cab driver, turned to sky diver  
Then to survivor, dying to break down  
A blood brother, surrogate mother  
Huggin' each other, cryin' their eyes out  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
I'm ecstatic like a drug addict  
Locked in the attic strung out and spellbound  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh, oh but I made it alive  
The sun's startin' to rise  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
(Lindsey Stirling solo)  
  
A bad feeling burned through the ceiling,  
Leaving my healing hard with a new scar.  
A dead fire rose and rose higher,  
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
We all suffer, but we recover,  
Just to discover life where we all are  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh, oh but I made it alive  
The sun's startin' to rise  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
My heart's burning bad, and it's turning black  
But I'm learning how to be stronger  
And sincerely, I love your dearly,  
Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander


That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb  
Rigged up and ready to drop  
The bad news: I'm a fuse and I've met my match  
So stand back it's about to go off  
  
That vixen, she's a master of disguise  
I see danger when I look in her eyes  
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise,  
So I'm running 'cause I've run out of time  
  
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate  
I'm James Bond, live to die another day  
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite  
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight  
  
(I, I'm on a mission tonight)  
  
Her love is a drug laced with ecstasy  
And her charm is spiked with a spell  
A hot mess in a dress gets the best of me,  
She's ice cold but she's making me melt  
  
That vixen, she's a master of disguise  
I see danger when I look in her eyes  
She's so foxy, she could lead to my demise,  
So I'm running 'cause I've run out of time  
  
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate  
I'm James Bond, live to die another day  
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite  
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight

If I was a raindrop  
You'd be my thunderstorm  
It's cold, so surround me  
With rain clouds to keep me warm  
I feel like I'm falling  
  
So darling, don't let me go  
The thought is appalling  
But should I slip away into the stormy sea  
Will you remember me  
  
Asleep in the warm cocoons  
We dream of lovely things  
We're both gonna wake up soon  
So we hope that tomorrow brings  
Us our "Butterfly Wings"  
  
If I was a grain of sand  
Would you be Miami Beach  
So dusty with starlight  
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me  
  
I'll try not to wake you  
Or make a sound while you're dozing off  
But in the night should the high tides  
Sweep me away from you  
Tell me again my dear, will you be waiting here  
  
Whenever we leave the ground  
And take to the sky  
I'll smile as I'm gazing down  
'Cause I've always wondered why  
We won't need feathers to fly


I am stuck in L.A through the week, and can?t get away  
And you?re alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday  
Stormy nights re-awake the stomachache that I?ve acquired  
From feeling down, things look grim and I?m so sick, of being tired  
Apartment lights go dark, and it?s depressing but what can I do?  
Midnight streets feel dead, when I am so used to driving with you  
Brighter lights fill the nights and bluer skies reflect in your eyes  
As I inspect and analyze all these dreams I don?t recognize  
If you?re still up when the ships in the port, prepare to set sail  
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail  
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?  
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you  
Count the stars, watch the waves, absorb the summer sun and think of me  
When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea  
Can you still hear my voice when I?m outside from over the phone?  
For what its worth darling dear, I wish you were here ?cause I feel alone  
When you were home, wed sing but since you?ve left I don?t hear anything  
And though I feel so sad I can?t believe things are really that bad  
Old captains and brand new cruise ships  
Sailing over the briny sea  
When I crash my beloved desk job  
And swim through the debris  
I?ll cut loose and leave this madhouse  
Bound for the Atlantic blue  
I?ll stroll down your tree-lined driveway  
And sail the ocean with you  


Please take a long hard look through your text book  
'Cause I'm history  
When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone  
Cause I've been dying to leave  
Yeah, I'll ride the range and hide all my loose change  
In my bedroom  
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike  
Always takes it's toll on me  
  
I've had just about enough  
Of quote, "diamonds in the rough"  
Because my backbone is paper thin  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in (I'll cave in, I'll cave in)  
  
If the bombs go off  
The sun will still be shining (the sun will still be shining)  
Because we've heard it said that every mushroom cloud  
Has a silver lining  
(Though we're always undermining too deep to know)  
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop  
'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen  
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane  
Mixed with stale gasoline  
I'll soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground  
I'll get ten minutes give-or-take  
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy  
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake  
  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in (cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in)  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in  
  
I'll keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in (in case my head caves
in)  
'Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps  
It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe  
Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track (so I stay on track)  
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away  
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back  
  
I won't even look back


Dementia, you're driving me crazy  
  
This is driving me crazy  
Dementia, Dementia, Dementia  
Every light in the night flickered in and out  
Every bone in my back shivered up and down  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every voice from my head shouted yes and no  
Every freight train that fought fought to stop and go  
Keep the pace in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Be surprised I'm a ghost keeping out of sight  
  
Open up your eyes you're a star in the summer night  
This is love this is war, it's insanity  
Dementia you're driving me crazy!  
Dementia, you're driving me crazy!  
This is driving me crazy  
Every tear in my eyes dripping wouldn't drop  
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop  
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies  
'Cause this is driving me crazy  
Every hand let me go that I try to hold,  
Every warm heart it loved left me feeling cold  
Keep the pace just in


Affection, the gifted architect  
Is making a draft and beautiful design  
The options and possibilities  
Are endless when we connect and re-align  
Collections of books and documents  
Arise and parade around my cluttered desk  
Re-working the math and measurements  
Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque  
Like mountains in the Midwest  
  
Reaction creates the columns dark  
And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale  
The structures begin to take their shape  
Before I've designed the public monorail  
The turnpike and high-speed motorway  
Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets  
The airport, the broad suspension bridge  
The lake and the beach, where several rivers meet  
Compounded from the spreadsheet  
  
A city sparkles in the night  
How can it glow so bright?  
The neighborhoods surround a soft fluorescent light  
Designer skyline in my head  
Abstract and still well-read  
You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead


We, were alone, on the road, driving faster  
So, far from home, we were chasing disaster  
Pour, on the gas, til the car, caught on fire  
We, had to laugh, as the smoke, billowed higher  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I, and I, and I say  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
  
Think, of the sun, and the sound, of it rising  
Still, on the run, with our eyes on the horizon  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I, and I, and I say  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the dreams and disasters  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters


Splashdown in the silver screen  
Into a deep dramatic scene  
I swim through the theater  
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer  
Like a kite in the bright midday  
Wonder stole my breath away  
  
Shy sonata for Mercury  
The stars always sing so pretty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
I made for the countryside  
  
And my eyes never grew so wide  
Apple, raspberry, river blue  
I don't wanna leave without you  
In the sound I'll gladly drown  
Into the emerald underground  
I rub my eyes 'cause it's hard to see  
  
Surrounded by all this beauty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
(I'm sad to see you go)  
(But I'd rather be alone)  
When tiger eyes begin making you blush  
When diamonds boast that they can't be crushed  
Let 'em go 'cause dreams don't turn to dust  
  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life, I'm sad to see you go  
I'll miss you with all my heart  
But I'd rather be alone  
'Cause I couldn't live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
  
So I'll drag the anchor up  
And rest assured  
'Cause dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
Dreams don't turn to dust  
I'll rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust


Good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us  
Someplace that I have never been  
It's chic transportation to  
New destination where  
I leave my reflection on the glass  
I'd ask but we don't know  
How far these interstates go  
Or how deep the city routes go down  
In chilly subdepth railways  
The weathered concrete stairways  
Provide me with the means of getting home  
If I ever leave  
  
(On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand while soothing words)  
  
So many sights to see  
So wake up like an early birdie  
And we'll get a head start on the day  
Oh, stained glass skyways  
And crowded six lane highways  
If I look back when I begin to leave  
Will they remember me?  
  
Circuit flights bend the light when I am spent  
And tour guides make happy brides through heaven soon  
  
Good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us  
  
(On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand  
While soothing words)  
  
On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand  
While soothing words hover like humming birds  
  
Good, good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us


There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive  
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes  
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive  
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to
life  
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
stay alive  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And you'll find, there'll be mornings when the ashes and embers are cold  
But you'll fight with a passion and you'll never stop 'cause you know  
Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told  
Every push, every shove, every war, every love  
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow  
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
stay alive  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
Don't let the fire die  
It gets better  
Just don't let the fire die, no  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
Don't let the fire die


There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles  
Same old tired, lonely place  
Walls of insincerity  
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"  
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
Oh taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you too  
  
The lingering question kept me up  
2am, who do you love?  
I wondered till I'm wide awake  
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door  
I'd open up and you would say,  
Hey it was enchanting to meet you  
Oh taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you too  
  
This is me praying that this was the very first page  
Not where the story line ends  
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again  
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you too  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
This night is flawless, don't you let it go  
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone  
Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you too  
  
I was never in love with someone else  
I never had somebody waiting on me  
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true  
And I just wish you knew  
Taylor I was so in love with you


If I could look across the country  
From California to New Jersey  
Then I would count the parks and lake resorts  
And number all the jets and airports  
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me  
'cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see  
If I could open up my window  
And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau  
Then I would survey all those open miles  
And line them up in single file  
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime  
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine  
If I was standing on the balcony  
And you were walking down below  
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place  
And lonely just to watch you go  
If you were swinging from the highway overpass  
Within the western hemisphere  
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere  
If you began to disappear  
If I was walking through a sad art gallery  
And you were driving through the night  
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease  
Beneath the brilliant showroom light  
If I was flying on a plane above your town  
And you were gazing at the sky  
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured  
If you began to wave goodbye  


Whoa-uh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-uh-oh  
It's always a good time  
  
Woke up on the right side of the bed  
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?  
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight  
'Cause it's always a good time  
  
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care  
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere  
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight  
'Cause it's always a good time  
  
Good morning and good night  
I'll wake up at twilight  
It's gonna be alright  
We don't even have to try  
It's always a good time (Whooo)  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time.  
  
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again  
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM  
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight  
'Cause it's always a good time  
  
Good morning and good night  
I'll wake up at twilight  
It's gonna be alright  
We don't even have to try  
It's always a good time (Whooo)  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
We don't even have to try,  
It's always a good time.  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
We don't even have to try,  
It's always a good time.  
  
Doesn't matter when  
It's always a good time then  
Doesn't matter where  
It's always a good time there  
  
Doesn't matter when,  
It's always a good time then  
  
It's always a good time  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
We don't even have to try,  
It's always a good time  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh  
It's always a good time  
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  
We don't even have to try,  
It's always a good time.


[Intro]  
I was a hot mess  
In my Sunday best  
Black tears in my eyes  
You were my first love  
You were my only one  
I can't believe your lies

Once we were like bottle rockets  
Now I know I have to stop it  
  
Please believe me  
This isn't easy  
I just need to say goodbye  
  
[Refrain]  
Goodbye (2x)  
Losin' my mind  
Goodbye  
  
[Verse]  
You got a new friend  
You like to play pretend  
I'm just keepin' my cool  
Turn on the smoke machine  
Magic and make believe  
She'll never know you like I do  
  
[Bridge]  
Once we were a fire burnin'  
Now you're just a lesson I'm learning  
  
Please believe me  
This isn't easy  
I just need to say goodbye  
  
[Refrain]  
Goodbye (2x)  
Losin' my mind  
Goodbye

I know that I can find somebody  
You won't ever find nobody else like me

Everywhere everybody needs a neighbor  
Showing up when times get hard  
But there's friends of sons and daughters  
Saying grace without supper in your backyard

There's a small-town girl in third grade  
Makin' sure her sisters get enough  
She sees her mama working two jobs worrying and crying,  
Doing everything but giving up  
If a miracle's a gift when you need it  
Then it's time for stepping in  
Here's to families and kids, where ever you live  
Never ever wondering again

Hey Anna, it's just a boy you won't understand if you try  
So, hey Anna, smile when he's holding your hand tonight  
Hey Anna, remember when you're wishing away your life

Makes your heart race  
And you wonder why'

You'll find the right one  
And you'll figure this all out

Just around the corner there's heartaches  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
You'll find me at the home of the blues  
I walk and cry while my heart beat  
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes  
The sun don't shine through this window of mine  
'Cause it's dark at the home of the blues  
  
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories  
Memories so sweet that I cry  
And dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad  
I just wanna give up and lay down and die  
  
So if you just lost your sweetheart  
And it seems that there's no good way to choose  
Well come along with me, misery loves company  
And you're welcome at the home of the blues  
'Cause just around the corner there's heartaches  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
You'll find me at the home of the blues  
You'll find me at the home of the blues  
You're gonna find me at the home of the blues


I survived a dreadful accident,  
In the car crash of the century,  
My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement,  
But in the back of the ambulance, I'd never felt so content.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.  
  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da.  
  
I tossed and turned, in sterile apathy,  
Until the violets arrived for me,  
The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room,  
And the police got smaller as they grew taller,  
And taught me to bloom.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.  
The curtains decayed, the daylight poured in,  
I was never afraid, of the darkness again,  
My burns were third degree,  
  
But I'd been set free,  
'Cause grace had finally found its way to me.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me,  
  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Through a grave emergency.  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Through a grave emergency.  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Through a grave emergency


We wrote a prelude  
To our own fairy tale  
And bought a parachute  
At a church rummage sale  
  
And with a mean sewing machine  
And miles of thread  
We sewed the day above L.A.  
In navy and red  
  
We wound a race track  
Through your mom's kitchen chairs  
And fought the shadows back  
Down your dark basement stairs  
  
I lit a match, then let it catch  
To light up the room  
And then you yelled as we beheld  
An old maroon hot air balloon  
  
I'll be out of my mind  
And you'll be out of ideas  
Pretty soon  
So let's spend  
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon  
Leave your jacket behind  
Lean out and touch the treetops over town  
I can't wait  
To kiss the ground  
Wherever we touch back down  
  
We drank the Great Lakes  
Like cold lemonade  
And both got stomach aches  
Sprawled out in the shade  
  
So bored to death you held your breath  
And I tried not to yawn  
You made my frown turn upside down  
And now my worries are gone  
  
I'll be out of my mind  
And you'll be out of ideas  
Pretty soon  
So let's spend  
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon  
Leave your jacket behind  
Lean out and touch the treetops over town  
I can't wait  
To kiss the ground  
Wherever we touch back down  
  
I'll be out of my mind  
And you'll be out of ideas  
Pretty soon  
So let's spend  
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon  
Leave your jacket behind  
Lean out and touch the treetops over town  
I can't wait  
To kiss the ground  
Wherever we touch back down


June was the lobster shell,  
I dug by hand, a haven that hid me well,  
Beneath the sand,  
The white windy waves washed in,  
But I stayed dry,  
The great breakers broke again,  
'Cause I'm on and off inside.  
And then, when the empress run aground,  
And my eyes turned blue and green,  
I heard a gorgeous sound,  
And that's when it became a dream,  
When the sky fell in,  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea.  
I wrenched the engines off,  
And dragged them down,  
The depths turned the iron soft,  
As they swiftly drowned,  
And I brought the ocean side,  
To its rusty knees,  
  
As I felt the even tide,  
Deep in my shallow dreams.  
And then, when the empress run aground,  
And my eyes turned blue and green,  
I heard a gorgeous sound,  
And that's when it became a dream,  
When the sky fell in,  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea.  
(When the sky fell in),  
When the sky fell in,  
(When the sky fell in),  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea,  
That's how I became the sea,  
That's how I became the sea


She wound the thread around the pieces of, my broken heart  
Had left me to believe  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
The starry nights without a fear of heights  
I can't recall, but I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
A blissful way she whispered in my ear  
Before she left, had me so convinced  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
And Juliet's romantic balcony  
Wears out the wall, and I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I feel alone  
I hope my ghost, never leaves  
'Cause when I'm home  
Your painful memory, is always haunting me  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing to me  
  
When I see you around, my eyes get wide  
When you race through my mind, I die inside  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I hope you think of me, I hope you think of me


You're the sky that I fell through  
And I remember the view  
Whenever I'm holding you  
The sun hung from a string  
Looking down on the world as it warmed over everything  
Chills run down my spine  
As our fingers entwine  
And your sighs harmonize with mine  
Unmistakably I can still feel your heart beat fast when you dance with me.  
  
We got older and I should have known  
(Do you feel alive)  
That I feel colder when I walk alone  
(Oh but you'll survive)  
So I may as well ditch my dismay  
(Bombs away, bombs away)  
  
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully  
Back and forth  
If my heart was a compass you'd be north  
Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall  
Wherever you go  
If my heart was a house you'd be home.  
  
It makes me smile because you said it best  
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west  
Flower balm perfume  
All my clothes smell like you  
Cause your favorite shade is navy blue  
  
I walk slowly when I'm on my own  
(Do you feel alive)  
Yeah but frankly I still feel alone  
(Oh but you'll survive)  
So I may as well ditch my dismay  
(Bombs away, bombs away)  
  
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully  
Back and forth  
If my heart was a compass you'd be north  
Risk it all 'cause I'll catch you if you fall  
Wherever you go  
If my heart was a house you'd be home.  
  
If my heart was a house you'd be home.


I saw your face in a criminal sketch  
Don't be alarmed 'cause you don't know me yet  
I'm on the prowl now sniffing around this town, for you  
  
Calling all cars there's an officer down  
Shot to the heart on a night on the town  
And the evidence of your fingerprints was found and now  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
Oh, no here we go once again  
We both know you'll never turn yourself in  
So I'm drivin' 'til it's light out  
Searchin' for your hide-out  
(drivin' 'til it's light out)  
(Searchin' for your hide-out)  
  
Pick up the pace as I chase you around  
One of these days I'll end up trackin' you down  
But, yeah, I got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do  
Because you,  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
I'm coming after you  
I'm coming' after you  
I'm coming' after you  
I'm coming' after you


Ladies and gentleman,  
Today is a day for mourning and remembering  
They had a hunger to explore the universe  
And discover its truths and  
They had that special grace  
That special spirit that says give me a challenge  
And I'll meet it with joy  
  
The crew of the space shuttle challenger  
Honored us in the manner  
Of which they lived their lives  
We will never forget them  
As they prepared for their journey  
And waved goodbye  
And they slipped the surly of earth  
To touch the face of God.


The princess in her flowerbed,  
Pulled the jungle underground,  
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red,  
And explosions never make a sound.  
Oh comet come down  
Kamikaze over me,  
And come alive  
My midnight melody  
Oh comet come down  
  
My captain on the snowy horse,  
He's coming back to take me home,  
(He's coming back to take me home!)  
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force,  
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone.  
Oh comet come down!  
Kamikaze over me,  
  
And come alive!  
My midnight melody!  
Oh comet come down!  
Kamikaze over me,  
And come alive!  
My midnight melody!  
Oh comet come down!  
Oh comet come down!  
  
(Break down the open doors)  
Maybe I'll write,  
(And fight back the undertones)  
To save my life,  
(Break in, the ember glows)  
Maybe I'll fly,  
(And go where you want to go)  
With the eagle eye!  
  
(Break down the open doors)  
Maybe I'll write,  
(And fight back the undertones)  
To save my life,  
(Break in, the ember glows)  
Maybe I'll fly,  
(And go where you want to go)  
With the eagle eye!  
(Eagle eye)


Symphony of silver tears,  
Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears,  
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on,  
But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.  
  
I sang my princess fast asleep,  
'Cause she was my dream come true,  
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.  
  
But now those lonely lullabies,  
Just dampen my tired eyes,  
Because I can't forget you.  
Because I can't forget you.  
  
I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,  
When the nightmares take me,  
I will scream with the howling wind,  
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.  
  
Dizzy love turned a star lily pink,  
And hung above our lids too flushed to blink,  
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,  
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold.  
  
I sang my princess fast asleep,  
'Cause she was my dream come true,  
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.  
  
But now those lonely lullabies,  
Just dampen my tired eyes,  
Because I can't forget you.  
Because I can't forget you.  
  
I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,  
When the nightmares take me,  
I will scream with the howling wind,  
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.  
  
I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,  
When the nightmares take me,  
I will scream with the howling wind,  
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.  
And I'd rather dream.  
  
Annmarie, I'll never forget you.  
Annmarie, I'll never forget you.  
Annmarie, remember me?  
I'll never forget you.  
Annmarie, remember me?  
I'll never forget you.  
Annmarie, remember me?  
I'll never forget you.


Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis  
  
So far apart, I check that the coast was clear,  
I feel like a post card,  
I wish you were here  
Subway through the dark, tearing through the park  
Taxi down the street, the avenue's at my feet  
Don't matter much to me  
What it is that I do  
As long as I'm coming home With you  
  
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,  
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
A thousand miles feels like a million years,  
Like hundreds of postcards  
That say I wish you were here!  
Airplane through the sky, grey all racing by,  
Air bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea,  
Don't matter much to me  
What it is that I do,  
As long as I'm coming home with you  
  
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,  
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
Like a high jacked plane,  
Or a runaway train,  
Or a speeding bullet,  
There's no stopping this!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
I left my heart in Metropolis!  
  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I can't even take it in  
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis


When my hope is lost  
And my strength is gone  
I run to you, and you alone  
When I can't get up and I can't go on  
I run to you, and you alone  
'Cause you're my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
You're my everything  
  
When I'm plagued with pain  
And filled with fear  
I run to you, and you alone  
When my days are few  
And death is near  
I run to you, and you alone  
'Cause you're my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
When trouble comes and goes  
And when the cold wind blows  
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up  
When sorrow knocks me down  
And you pick me off the ground  
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up  
  
And I sing, Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours, and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
  
Hallelujah  
By the grace of God above  
Hallelujah  
Our shining light to shine above  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
You're my everything  
  
Ohh ohh, you're my everything


I'm moving to Tokyo  
'cause I'm tired of San Francisco  
My contracts are finally void  
And I am getting out  
On houses and building tops  
I swallow the beams and sundrops  
If my echos could reach your ears  
Then I could save my calls  
What happens when I'm above  
The east river when you are in love  
We're staring at all these lights  
And I am going blind  
Fill all of the navy yards  
With hard working security guards  
'cause the numbers are wearing off  
My plastic access cards  
How can I begin to say  
I feel better off when we stay  
In Paris on winter nights  
Beneath the snowy veil  
Content like a panda bear  
Still breathing the fresh mountain air  
I'll put on a diving tank  
And sing when I inhale  


There's the snow,  
Look out below,  
And bundle up 'cause here it comes,  
Run outside,  
So starry-eyed,  
A snowball fight breaks out,  
And winter has finally begun...  
  
I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace 'til I slip on the sidewalk
and fall on my face,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar-sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?  
  
Hop in the sleigh,  
And we'll glide away into the night,  
And we'll sip on moonlight,  
Runny nose,  
My frosty toes are getting cold but I feel alive so I smile wide  
  
The snowflakes start falling and I start to float 'til my mean older brother
stuffs snow down my coat,  
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet,  
I don't need to taste to believe,  
What's December without Christmas Eve?


I saw a ghost on the stairs,  
And sheets on the tables and chairs,  
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink,  
Even so, I don't know, what to think.  
I've been longing for,  
Daisies to push through the floor,  
And I wish that plant life would grow all around me,  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
  
I saw a bear in the den,  
Reading my textbooks again,  
That bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic,  
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend.  
  
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?  
I've been longing for,  
Daisies to push through the floor,  
And I wish plant life would grow all around me,  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
So I won't feel dead anymore.  
  
Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet,  
And give me a ghost of a smile,  
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're teddy beneath,  
So just grin and bear it a while.  
Just grin and bear it a while.  
  
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?  
  
Today I'm busting out,  
Of this old haunted house,  
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for,  
All the spider webs to grow all around me,  
'Cause I don't feel dead anymore.  
And I'm not afraid anymore.  
  
I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest,  
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,  
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?  
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?


High rise, veins of the avenue  
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue  
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you  
  
Street lights glisten on the boulevard  
And cold nights make staying alert so hard  
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard  
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay  
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?  
  
Small town hearts of the New Year  
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear  
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier  
  
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat  
With new taste for speed, out on the street  
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet  
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow  
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known  
That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone  
  
Your nerves gather with the altitude  
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued  
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood  
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway  
The high tide could take me so far away  
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day  
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age  
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align  
  
We were the crashing whitecaps  
On the ocean  
And what lovely seaside holiday, away  
A palm tree in Christmas lights  
My emotion  
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone  
As we spent the day alone  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known  
That we'd grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone


To pay or not to pay that is the question  
It refused to stay as it all turned grey  
Or William Shakespeare's receding hair  
  
Please excuse the pun, it's hair today, gone tomorrow  
So be thankful for what precious locks you have  
  
Toupee, or not toupee, that is the question  
And by the way, I just gotta say,  
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald  
  
And if I may quip, my curls and I  
Are just like heaven  
And rest assured, there'll be no parting there  
  
But should my head get bare like Frier Tuck  
Hard taste to swallow  
It makes me smile, 'cause I know just what I'd do  
  
Yeah if I had more wigs, than I knew what to do with  
I'd open a second hand store  
And if you ever went bald, you'd recall it  
'Cause I'd cleverly call it 'Rugs from me to you'


Close your tired eyes, relaxing them  
Count from one to ten and open them  
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time  
  
Way up in the air, you're finally free, and you can stay up there, right next
to me  
All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Gazing into my eyes, when the fire starts,  
And fan the flame so hot, it melts our hearts  
All the pouring rain, will try to put it out, but not this time  
  
Let your colors burn, and brightly burst,  
Into a million sparks, but all dispersed and illuminate a world,  
That'll try to bring you down, but not this time  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
A thousand heartbeats beating time, and makes this dark planet come alive  
So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine  
  
When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,  
Then it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are  
Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,  
'Cause it's time for you to shine  
Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Brighter than a shooting star,  
Shine no matter where you are, tonight


Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes  
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes  
  
She dried my eyes and drifted off  
While every tear was held aloft  
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible  
'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful  
  
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes  
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)  
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)  
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes  
  
Beautiful  
  
'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful


So there we were, back home  
From somewhere inside my head  
Well bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed  
Pillars of post-war books supported my frame of mind  
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind  
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me  
The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see  
Implying that she's the bees knees and I am the cats meow  
It's funny how she recalls when I can't remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
Yeah, but she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
I got a sunburn  
  
So there we were out there  
Unaware of where we'd been  
We kicked off our flip-flops  
And swung from the rooftops again  
It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about  
And it's funny how I recall when she can't remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
Yeah, But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
Oh afterglow, look out below!  
We'd left a trail of dust behind  
As we parted ways, she held my gaze,  
And left an imprint on my mind  
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye  
And hung the clouds above my town  
But I shed a tear when she disappeared  
'Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didn't feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn  
But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
She got a tan and I got a sunburn  
Yeah, but she got a tan and I got a sunburn


I'm alone above the atmosphere  
And no one looking up can find me here  
'Cause I can close my eyes, and disappear  
When I climb the stairs, to watch the sun  
Above the station walls, the colors run  
To fill the swimming pool, when I am done  
  
I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins  
  
When the satellites hang all around  
And I can finally hear the lovely sound  
When all the engines in the back room die down  
All the airships move across the sky  
And my equipment just keeps standing by  
The planets glow, and intensify  
  
I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins  
  
When you are lying half asleep in your room  
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon  
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell  
It could be raining, but then you can never tell  
  
If you're alone in this awful downpour  
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door  
  
In the evening light, the boulevard  
Conceals the night, with disregard  
For all the workers in a west coast shipyard  
When I rearrange, the silverware  
And re-install the lights, in captain's chair  
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air  
  
I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travel through your veins  
  
When you are lying half asleep in your room  
Unaware if it is midnight, or afternoon  
Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell  
It could be raining, but then you can never tell  
  
If you're awake in this awful downpour  
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door  
When you are swimming in Miami at night  
And all around you in the traffic and city lights


There was a shot in the dark  
I was caught by surprise  
There was a hole in my heart  
There were tears in your eyes  
And there was nothing to say  
'Cause you made up your mind  
And so I guess what you meant  
When you left was goodbye  
  
So if you're gonna go  
And leave me in a lonely gray  
I won't let it show  
Until you finally float away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it all away, take it all away  
You tear it up when you say  
You wanna take it all away, take it all away!  
You were the one, and it was enough  
To be the one you were dreaming of!  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it away, take away!  
  
I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek  
And as I tried to digest the words I couldn't believe  
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve  
Making it easy to hurt, and even harder to breathe  
  
So if you gonna go  
And leave me in the lonely gray  
I won't let it show  
Until you finally float away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it away, take it away  
You tear me up when you say  
You wanna take it away, take it all away!  
You were the one, and it was enough  
To be the one you were dreaming of  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it all away, take it all away!  
You take it all away, you take it all away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it all away, take it all away  
You tear me up when you say  
You wanna take it away, take it all away!  
You were the one, and it was enough (it was enough)  
To be the one you were dreaming of (dreaming of)  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it away, take away!  
You take it all away, you take it all away


When I am fast asleep  
I dream and see you floating high above me  
And I awake at dawn  
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn  
From on the bedroom floor  
I watch you sailing far above the seashore  
In deep Atlantic skies  
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise  
Above the avenue  
I search above the clouds, trying to see you  
But you are just a blur  
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor  
  
I can see  
You above with the ocean around me  
If I could only stay  
Overhead in the airway  
You sail through  
Endless sky with the evening around you  
When I'm out on the bay  
You're aloft in the airway  
  
When I'm alone at night  
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight  
Suspended in the air  
I wish your silhouette would always stay there  
When I am on the beach  
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach  
But I can not take flight  
Or float upon the air the way that you might  
When I am in the sea  
You gazed down from the sky, trying to see me  
But I am just a blur  
Through the waves, as I scuba dive below the harbor  
  
The airway  
You and I in the airway  
Aloft in the airway  
In love in the airway  
  
I can see  
You above with the ocean around me  
If I could only stay  
Overhead in the airway  
You sail through  
Endless sky with the evening around you  
When I'm out on the bay  
You're aloft in the airway


Its Christmas and we walk alone,  
To strangers with noone to miss us,  
On our own,  
Out in the cold,  
  
Trudging onward,  
Braving a harsh winter storm,  
You and I met passing by,  
And now our spirits feel warm,  
I don't have anyone at home,  
To talk to,  
And you don't have anything to do,  
So I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
  
I'll spend my Christmas,  
  
It's Christmas,  
And we are in love,  
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us,  
From far above,  
The blustery breeze,  
  
Trudging onward,  
Braving a harsh winter storm,  
You and I met passing by and now our spirits feel warm,  
  
I believe,  
That Jesus is truly the only way,  
And I celebrate,  
Christmas because it's his birthday,  
  
I don't have anyone at home to talk to,  
And you don't have anything to do,  
So I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
  
I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
I'll spend my Christmas with you,  
I'll spend my Christmas with you.


Don't remind me  
That some days I'm the windshield  
And other days I'm just a lucky bug  
These cold iron rails  
Leave old mossy trails  
Through the countryside  
The crow and the beanfield  
Are my best friends, but boy I need a hug  
  
(Boy I need a hug)  
  
'Cause my heart stops without you  
There's something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
Don't remind me  
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky  
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about  
'Cause when the stars silhouette me  
I'm scared they'll forget me and flicker out  
I taste honey but I haven't seen the hive  
Yeah, I didn't look, I didn't even try  
  
But still my heart stops without you  
'Cause there's something about you  
That makes me feel alive  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
We are honey and the bee  
  
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me  
I fell in love with you like bees to honey  
Let's up and leave the weeping to the willow tree  
And pour our tears in the sea  
  
I swear  
There's a lot of vegetables out there  
That crop up for air  
Yeah, I never thought  
We were two peas in a pod  
To be suddenly bloomed  
And I knew that I'd always love you  
  
Oh, I'll always love you too  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If the green left the grass on the other side  
I would make like a tree and leave  
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide  
Who knew the other side could be so green  
  
If I reached for your hand for the rest of my life  
Who knew the other side could be so green


I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,  
Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet.  
And you blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings,  
To gaze down on the city below, ablaze with wondrous things.  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.  
I wouldn't wanna live there.  
  
Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies,  
I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes.  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.  
From the green belt balcony, the wildfires look so pretty.  
Ponderosa canopy, I'd never leave if it were up to me.  
To the ruby redwood tree, and to the velvet climbing ivy:  
Painted all mahogany, I'd never leave if it were up to me.  
  
With a starry brush, paint the dusk Venetian blue,  
Because in the evening hush, you'll never believe the view.  
And when the leaves return and their whisperings fill the night,  
They'll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide.  
Where fire and ice collide.  
  
Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?  
If we dissolve without a trace, will the real world even care?  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.  
I wouldn't want to live there.  
  
I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,  
Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet


I opened my eyes last night  
And saw you in the low light  
Walking down by the bay  
On the shore,  
Staring up at the stars, that aren't there anymore  
I was feeling the night grow old  
And you were looking so cold  
So like an introvert  
I drew my over shirt  
Around my arms and began, to shiver violently before  
You happened to look  
And see the tunnels all around me  
Running into the dark  
Underground  
All the subways around, create a great sound  
To my motion fatigue  
Farewell  
With your ear to a seashell  
You can hear the waves in underwater caves  
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
  
Can you believe that the crew has gone  
And wouldn't let me sign on?  
All my islands have sunk  
In the deep,  
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep  
But I feel more with your hand  
In mine  
When we walk on the shore line  
I guess we'll never know, why sparrows love the snow  
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  
  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
(Yeah all the time) all the time  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?  
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time, all the time  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time,  
All the time


Welcome back  
Winter once again  
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater  
Cause you'll feel much better when  
  
The snowflakes fall  
Gently to the ground  
The temperature drops  
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around  
But I keep you warm  
  
If speed's a pro  
Inertia must be a con  
Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates  
When I've got my ice skates on  
  
If all the roads  
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack  
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska  
Then on to Alaska and back  
Cause you keep me warm  
  
Peer over the edge  
Can you see me?  
Rivulets flow from your eyes  
Paint runs from your mouth  
Like a waterfall  
And your lungs crystallize  
  
I'll travel the sub-zero tundra  
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes  
And that's just the tip of the iceberg  
I'll do whatever it takes  
To change  
  
Farewell powdery paradise  
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice  
Fingers failed us before they froze  
Frostbite bit down on all our toes  
  
Snow drifts build up and enfold us  
As we wait out this winter storm  
So we snuggle close in the darkness  
And keep each other so warm


Wake up on your own  
And look around you 'cause you?re not alone  
Release your high hopes and they?ll survive  
'cause this is the future and you are alive  
  
Dive in and swim away  
From your loneliness and miserable days  
  
And when you wake up on your own  
Look around you 'cause you?re not alone  
Let your hopes go and they?ll survive  
'cause this is the future and you are alive  
?You?re headed home


[Intro]  
An 8 year old girl had a panic attack  
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back  
No longer the hero, she counted on  
He told her he loved her and then he was gone  
  
[Verse 1]  
She tried to look happy in front of her friends  
But knew that she'd never feel normal again  
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes  
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end  
  
[Verse 2]  
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked  
But nobody knew he was dying inside  
He promised his family he'd be all right  
And then with a gunshot he left them behind  
  
[Chorus (x2)]  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end  
  
[Verse 3]  
The role of a father, he never deserved  
He abandonned his daughter and never returned  
And over the years though the pain was real  
She finally forgave him, and started to heal  
  
[Bridge]  
How close to the ending? Well, nobody knows  
The future's a mystery and anything goes  
Love is confusing and life is hard  
You fight to survive cause you made it this far  
  
[Outro]  
It's all too astounding to comprehend  
It's just the beginning this isn't the end  
It's just the beginning this isn't the end


I wish I could cross my arms and cross your mind  
'Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve  
All my life I wish I broke mirrors instead of promises  
'Cause all I see is a shattered conscience staring right back at me  
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely  
'Cause I'm so afraid, is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just
the train  
Lift your arms, only heaven knows where the danger grows  
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way  
  
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity  
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me  
  
Depression please cut to the chase and cut a long story short  
Oh please be done, how much longer can this drama afford to run  
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend  
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again  
  
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity  
'Cause it came down like a tidal wave and sorrow swept over me  
Then I was given grace and love  
I was blind but now I can see  
'Cause I've found a new hope from above  
And courage swept over me  
  
It hurts just to wake up whenever you're wearing thin  
Alone on the outside  
So tired of looking in  
The end is uncertain  
And I've never been so afraid  
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope  
And that makes me feel brave


Feels like I've been away for a thousand years  
So tired of these airports and souvenirs  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most when I'm in Tokyo  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast, when I'm in Tokyo  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh,and I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close, when I'm in Tokyo  
  
I wander all alone in the pouring rain  
Line-shocking on the wind, in the bullet train  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most when I'm in Tokyo  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast, when I'm in Tokyo  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close, when I'm in Tokyo  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
  
And hold you close when I'm in Tokyo  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)


Stands and gears, oh how the daisies bloom  
When chandeliers light up the engine room  
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain  
There's an underwater Ferris wheel where  
I found the missing link to this island chain  
  
Home will always be here unseen, out of sight  
Where I disappear and hide  
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye  
So I'll spread out my wings and fly  
  
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach  
Hidden under umbrella beach  
  
Home will always be here, unseen, out of sight  
Where I disappear and hide  
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye  
So I'll spread out my wings and fly  
  
I'll spread my wings and fly  
  
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach  
Hidden under umbrella beach


The stars lean down to kiss you  
And I lie awake and miss you  
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere  
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly  
But I'll miss your arms around me  
I'd send a postcard to you, dear  
'Cause I wish you were here  
  
I'll watch the night turn light blue  
But it's not the same without you  
Because it takes two to whisper quietly  
The silence isn't so bad  
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad  
'Cause the spaces between my fingers  
Are right where yours fit perfectly  
  
I'll find repose in new ways  
Though I haven't slept in two days  
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone  
But drenched in vanilla twilight  
I'll sit on the front porch all night  
Waist deep in thought because when  
I think of you I don't feel so alone  
  
I don't feel so alone  
I don't feel so alone  
  
As many times as I blink  
I'll think of you tonight  
  
I'll think of you tonight  
  
When violet eyes get brighter  
And heavy wings grow lighter  
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again  
And I'll forget the world that I knew  
But I swear I won't forget you  
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past  
I'd whisper in your ear,  
"Oh darling I wish you were here"


[Verse 1:]  
It's another bad dream  
Poison in my blood stream  
I'm dying but I can't scream (Can't scream)  
Will you show me the way?  
  
It's another wolf bite  
Howlin' in the moonlight  
I wanna get my life right!  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Post-chorus:]  
Will you show me the way,  
Tonight?  
Will you show me the way,  
Tonight?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
It's another nightmare  
I swear there's something out there  
So save me cause I'm so scared  
Will you show me the way?  
  
It's another warewolf  
All dressed up in sheep's wool  
And changing when the moon's full  
Will you show me the way?  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls  
In my despair (In my despair)  
Will you be there?  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way?  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear?  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way?  
Tonight  
  
[Outro:]  
In my despair  
Will you be there?  
Tonight
