[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
I got a heart, and I got a soul  
Believe me, I use them both  
We made a start, be it a false one I know  
Baby, I don't want to feel alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Verse 2: Niall Horan]  
We took a chonce, God knows we've tried  
Yet all along I knew we'd be fine  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
So pour me a drink, oh love  
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything we can  
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
  
[Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson]  
To be loved and to be in love  
  
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
And I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen


[Verse 1: Niall]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because I move a little slow when I dance  
  
[Hook: Liam]  
I can count on you  
After all that we been through  
Cause I know that you'll always understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No I'll still feel the same around you  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because the stories that I've told  
I tell again and again  
  
[Hook: Zayn]  
I can count on you  
After all we got up to  
Because I know that you'll truly understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out  
We'll still stay up 'til morning  
We'll throw an after party  
Oh yeah, oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too


My mother told me I should go and get some therapy  
I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?  
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet  
I can't control it  
Yeah, I know it's taking over me  
I'm going crazy  
Can't contain it  
So tell me just what I should do?"  
  
She said, "Hey, it's alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don't look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it's only for tonight"  
She said, "Hey, it's alright  
If it makes you feel alive"  
  
Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me  
I met a girl, I took her in up to the balcony  
I whispered something in her ear that I just can't repeat  
She said, "okay" but she was worried what her friends will think  
She's going crazy  
Can't contain it  
She asked me, "What should I do, oh?"  
  
I said, "Hey, it's alright.  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don't look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it's only for tonight"  
I said, "Hey, it's alright  
If it makes you feel alive"  
  
We got to live before we get older  
Do what we like  
We got nothing to lose  
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders  
Oh, we got nothing to prove  
  
I said, "Hey, it's alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don't look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it's only for tonight"  
  
I said, "Hey, it's alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don't look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it's only for tonight"  
I said, "Hey, it's alright  
If it makes you feel alive"

I know you say  
That you don't like it complicated  
That we should try to keep it simple  
But love is never ever simple, no

He knows about you in every way  
He's memorized every part of your face  
Inside and out, baby, head to toe  
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know  
  
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods  
The songs that you sing when you're all alone  
Your favorite band, and the way that you dance  
But baby, baby

But there's no hiding the smile on your face  
Inside and out, baby, head to toe  
He's not around, girl, you let me know  
  
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods  
The songs that you sing when you're all alone

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
I'm like a crow on a wire  
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly, oh  
I'm like a boat on the water  
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind  
Oh, every time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]  
But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless  
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see, two feet in front of me  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And I know in my heart, you're just a moving part  
  
[Chorus:]  
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Yeah, I know your love's not real  
That's not the way it feels  
That's not the way you feel  
  
[Chorus:]  
And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold


You don't understand, you don't understand  
What you do to me when you hold his hand  
We were meant to be but a twist of fate  
Made it so you had to walk away  
  
'Cause we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now  
Yeah, we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now

I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So c'mon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
It's four a.m. and I know that you're with him  
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin  
And if he feels my traces in your hair  
Sorry, love, but I don't really care  
  
'Cause we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now

I, I will be king  
And you, you will be queen  
Though nothing will drive them away  
We can beat them, just for one day  
We can be Heroes, just for one day  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
  
I, I wish you could swim  
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim  
Though nothing,  
Nothing could keep us together  
Oh we can be Heroes,  
Just for one day  
  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
  
I, I can remember (I remember)  
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)  
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)  
We could be Heroes,  
Just for one day  
  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes  
We can be Heroes

Just for one day


Don't try to make me stay  
Or ask if I'm okay  
I don't have the answer  
Don't make me stay the night  
Or ask if I'm alright  
I don't have the answer.  
  
Heartache doesn't last forever  
I'll say I'm fine  
Midnight ain't no time for laughing  
When you say goodbye.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible.  
  
I've tried to ask myself  
Should I see someone else?  
I wish I knew the answer.  
  
But I know, if I go now, if I leave  
Then I'm on my own tonight  
I'll never know the answer.  
  
Midnight doesn't last forever  
Dark turns to light  
Heartache flips my world around  
I'm falling down, down, down,  
That's why.  
  
I find your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible).  
  
It's in your lips and in your kiss  
It's in your touch and your fingertips  
And it's in all the things and other things  
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
Irresistible.


Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me  
But bear this mind it was meant to be  
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks  
And it all makes sense to me  
  
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile  
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs  
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine  
But I'll love them endlessly  
  
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth  
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to  
I'm in love with you and all these little things  
  
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea  
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep  
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep  
Though it makes no sense to me  
  
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape  
You never want to know how much you weigh  
You still have to squeeze into your jeans  
But you're perfect to me  
  
I won't let these little things slips out of my mouth  
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to  
I'm in love with you and all these little things  
  
You never love yourself half as much as I love you  
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to  
If I let you know, I'm here for you  
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh  
  
I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth  
Because it's Lou, oh it's Lou, it's Lou they add up to  
And I'm in love with Lou (and all his little things)  
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth  
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to  
I'm in love with you, and all your little things


If this room was burning  
I wouldn't even notice  
'Cause you've been taking up my mind  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
You say it's getting late  
It's getting late  
And you don't know if you can stay  
If you can stay  
  
But you, you don't tell the truth  
No you, you like playing games  
  
Your hands touching me, they're touching me  
And your eyes keep saying things  
They say what we do  
When it's only me and you  
I can't concentrate  
  
That's all I'm thinking about  
All I keep thinking about  
Everything else just fades away  
  
If this room was burning  
I wouldn't even notice  
'Cause you've been taking up my mind  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
You say you're a good girl  
But I know you would girl  
'Cause you've been telling me all night  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
Back seat of the cab,  
We're in the cab  
My lips getting so attached,  
They're so attached  
  
Now you wanna make some rules  
Now cool then we'll watch them break tonight  
  
I know what you want  
And I've been waiting so long  
  
If this room was burning  
I wouldn't even notice  
'Cause you've been taking up my mind  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
You say you're a good girl  
But I know you would girl  
'Cause you've been telling me all night.  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
I know you want it  
I know you feel it too  
Let's stop pretending  
That you don't know what I don't know  
Just what we came to do  
  
If this room was burning  
I wouldn't even notice  
'Cause you've been taking up my mind  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
  
You say you're a good girl  
But I know you would girl  
'Cause you've been telling me all night  
With your little white lies, little white lies  
With your little white lies, little white lies


[Verse 1: Niall]  
We made a fire, went down in the flames  
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the waves  
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed  
We had it all, yeah and we walked away  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around  
I try to forgive you but I struggle cause I don't know how  
We built it up so high and now I'm falling  
It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here  
  
[Verse 2: Louis]  
We had a mountain, but took it for granted  
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it  
We found an island, but we got stranded  
We had it all yeah, who could've planned it?  
  
[Chorus: Liam]  
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around  
I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling cause I don't know how  
We built it up so high and now I'm falling  
It's a long way down from here, such a long way down from here  
It's a long way down, it's a long way down  
Such a long way down, it's a long way down, it's a long way down


If I don't say this now I will surely break  
As I'm leaving the one I want to take  
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait  
My heart has started to separate  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'll look after you  
  
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go  
Will you, won't you be the one I always know?  
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around  
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'll look after you  
  
If ever there was a doubt  
My love she leans into me  
This most assuredly counts  
She says most assuredly  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
I'll look after you  
  
It's always have and never hold  
You've begun to feel like home  
What's mine is yours to leave or take  
What's mine is yours to make your own  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh


She's seventeen,  
And gets to thinking,  
About Prom Queen and partying,  
  
Can't get her head on straight,  
But has to try before it's too late,  
But I don't think she has a chance,  
  
I know you, you know me,  
But you're too proud to show me,  
The way you really see the world,  
  
I'm here to help,  
And I'm sure it feels like hell,  
Come take my hand we'll fly away to promised lands,  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see that this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
Please believe,  
That we aren't just here,  
Sitting watch you do your thing,  
  
You want to scream, but,  
Those chains they hold you down,  
And I won't wait to get you off the ground,  
  
Free to look forward to what is at hand,  
If there's something to ask,  
It's too short for a regret,  
  
People make mistakes,  
And I'm here to lead the way,  
To see you spread your wings.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.

[Liam]  
You're insecure, so half of four,  
Your old brains are not what they were before,  
[Zayn]  
Add two threes, it's fine for us,  
'Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff  
  
[Harry]  
Everyone else can multiply by 60,  
Everyone else can add two  
  
[All]  
And Now take off one hundred and add on 24,  
Then divide by two and add on seven more  
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible  
  
[All]  
If only you had a mind like me  
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three,  
And then just add on the age of this OAP  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible (o oh)  
  
[Harry]  
It's really kinda pitiful


1, 2, 3  
  
Straight off the plane to a new hotel  
Just touched down, you could never tell  
A big house party with a crowded kitchen  
People talk shh but we don't listen  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everwhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
5 foot something with the skinny jeans  
Don't look back, baby follow me  
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way  
Same old shh but a different day  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
You and me and all our friends  
I don't care how much we spend  
Baby, this is what the night is for,  
I know nothing's making sense  
For tonight let's just pretend  
I don't wanna stop so give me more  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it


Shut the door  
Turn the light off  
If I wanna be with you  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna lay beside you  
I cannot hide this  
Even though I try  
  
Heartbeats harder  
Time escapes me  
Trembling hands touch skin  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Close the door  
Throw the key  
Don't wanna be reminded  
Don't wanna be seen  
Don't wanna be without you  
My judgement's clouded  
Like tonight's sky  
  
Hands are silent  
Voice's numb  
Try to scream out, my lungs  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face.  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Flashing lights in my mind  
Going back to the time  
Playing games in the street  
Kicking balls at my feet  
There's a numb in my toes  
Standing close to the edge  
There's a pile of my clothes  
At the end of your bed  
As I feel myself fall  
Make a joke of it all  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today


[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Stained coffee cup  
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
Sweet, where you lay  
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
Taste, on my tongue  
I don't want to wash away the night before  
  
[Verse 4: Harry Styles]  
In the heat, where you lay  
I could stay right here and burn in it all day  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless  
Her perfume's holding me ransom  
Sweet and sour, heart devoured  
Lying here I count the hours  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control


You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry  
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye  
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart  
You're tearing me apart  
  
You're so London your own style, your own style  
And together we're so good so girl why  
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart  
You're tearing me apart  
  
Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile,  
Baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on,  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
  
We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed  
I remember the taste of your lipstick  
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart,  
You're tearing up my heart  
  
Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me  
From not moving on, baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
Nobody compares to you  
  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you


Nobody knows  
Nobody knows but me  
That I sometimes cry  
If I could pretend that I'm asleep  
When my tears start to fall  
I peek out from behind these walls  
I think nobody knows  
Nobody knows no  
Baby  
Oh the secret's safe with me  
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be  
And baby don't it feel like I'm all alone  
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown  
And I've lost my way back home  
I think nobody knows no  
I said nobody knows  
Nobody cares  
Baby  
Oh the secret's safe with me  
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be  
And baby don't it feel like I'm all alone  
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown  
And I've lost my way back home  
I think nobody knows no  
I said nobody knows  
Nobody cares


[Verse 1: Niall]  
Remember the day we were giving up when you told me I didn't give you enough  
And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you  
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on, just thinking how I went about it wrong  
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam]  
Please believe me, don't you see  
The things you mean to me?  
Oh I love you, I love you  
I love, I love, I love Olivia  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
Say what you're feeling and say it now cause I got the feeling you're walking
out  
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya  
The consequences are falling now, there's something I'm having nightmares
about  
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam]  
Please believe me, don't you see  
The things you mean to me?  
Oh I love you, I love you  
I love, I love, I love Olivia  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
When you go and I'm alone, you live in my imagination  
The summertime and butterflies  
All belong to your creation  
I love you, it's all I do, I love you  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go


Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
We make no mistakes  
Not even the landslide or riptide  
Could take it all the way  
  
[Zayn]  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
That we are always safe  
  
Not even the bad guys in The Dark Knight  
Could take it all the way  
  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime you were mine


Every path you take  
Every move you make  
It can change your life  
  
But with every breath you take  
All the tears you've wasted  
You think failure's kind  
  
Angels over you now  
Bribes you to see this out  
Cuz your not the only one  
  
Look up your almost done  
This life it can be won  
Just pull it out of you,  
And shine like the brightest sun  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life  
I'll be by your side  
  
Well if you're as kind  
And an open mind  
We will make it  
Make it through this life  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life

And an open mind

So girl forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight

[Verse:]  
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny  
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, running out of time  
Without you I'll never make it out alive  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
There's a devil in your smile it's chasing me  
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed  
There's a moment when you finally realize  
There's no way you can change the rolling tide  
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There's a future in my life I can't foresee  
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me  
There will always be the kind that criticize  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
I'd give everything that I've got for your love  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run


Lights go down, and  
The night is calling to me, yeah  
I hear voices  
Singing songs in the street and I know  
That we won't be going home  
For so long, for so long, but I know  
That I won't be on my own, yeah  
  
I love this feeling that right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
  
Late night spaces  
With all our friends, you and me, yeah  
Love these faces  
Just like how it used to be  
And we won't be going home  
For so long, for so long, but I know,  
I won't be on my own, on my own  
  
I'm feeling like right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
  
And I could do this forever  
Whoa, whoa  
And let's go crazy together  
Whoa, whoa  
  
Lights go down and  
I hear you calling to me, yeah  
  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me


Do you remember summer '09  
Wanna go back there every night  
Just can't lie it was the best time of my life  
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out  
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud  
Oh my my they could never shut us down  
  
I used to think that I was better alone  
Why did I ever want to let you go  
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea  
The words you whispered I will always believe  
  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me, yeah  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care

Wanna roll back like press and rewind  
You were mine and we never said goodbye  
  
I used to think that I was better alone (Better alone)  
Why did I ever want to let you go?(Let you go)  
Under the moonlight as we stared to the sea (Stared at the sea)

I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh  
  
It's a quarter to three can't sleep at all  
You're so overrated  
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall  
And he wouldn't take it  
  
All that you want's under your nose, yeah  
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh

But for you I'll be super human  
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
  
Oh now you're at home  
And he don't call  
Cause he don't adore ya  
To him you are just another doll  
And I tried to warn ya  
  
What you want, what you need  
Has been right here, yeah  
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight


She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah  
Tight dress with the top cut low  
She's addicted to feeling of letting go, oh, ohoo, let it go  
  
She walks in and the room just lights up  
But she don't want anyone to know  
That I'm the only one who gets to take her home, oh, ohoo  
Take her home  
  
But everytime I tell her that I want more  
She closes the door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
Maybe she's just trying to test me  
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work  
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth  
What your worth  
  
Or maybe all her friends have told her  
Don't' get closer he'll just break your heart  
  
But either way she's teasing me  
And it's just so hard (So hard)  
  
'Cause every time I tell her how I feel  
She says it's not real  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
What about all the things we said?  
Talking on the phone so late  
I can't let her get away from me (Ohh)  
  
When I say that I can't do it no more  
She's back in my door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love (Ohoo, ohoo)  
She's not afraid  
She's not afraid (Ohoo, ohoo)


I was her she was me  
We were one we were free  
And if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
  
We were young we were wrong  
We were fine all along  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
When you get to where you wanna go  
And you know the things you wanna know  
You're smiling  
When you said what you wanna say  
And you know the way you wanna play  
You'll be so high you'll be flying  
  
Though the sea will be strong  
I know we'll carry on  
Cos if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
She's the one  
Yeah she's the one  
Yeah she's the one  
She's the one


One day you'll come into my world and say it all  
You say we'll be together even even you're lost  
One day you'll say these words  
I thought you'll never say  
You say we're better off together in our bed  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
The script was written and I could not change a thing  
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again  
One day I'll come into your world and get it right  
I'll say we're better off together here tonight  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
You're all I want  
So much it's hurting  
You're all I want  
So much it's hurting


From the moment I met you, everything changed  
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain  
I had to take you and make you mine  
  
I would walk through the desert  
I would walk down the aisle  
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile  
Whatever it takes is fine  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
Every piece of your heart  
  
I know your hearts been broken  
But don't you give up  
I'll be there, yeah I know it  
To fix you with love  
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
Every piece of your heart  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
  
And I will steal us a car  
And we will drive to the stars  
I will give you the moon  
It's the least I can do if you give me the chance  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
You can call me a thief  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
But you should know your part  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
I'm only here  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Because you stole my heart  
  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
So put your hands up  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving till I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
  
Cause you stole my heart  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Call me a thief  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
But you should know your part  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
I'm only here  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Because you stole my heart

[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?  
I've been here for days  
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never 'gonna get away?  
  
[Verse 2: Zayn Malik]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But I fear I'm getting used to  
Being held by you  
  
[Chorus: All Members]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby you got me tied down  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
  
[Verse 3: Louis Tomlinson]  
Who's this man that's holding your hand  
And talking about your eyes?  
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind  
  
[Verse 4: Niall Horan]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room  
Yeah I fell for you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me

[Bridge: Liam Payne]

But now together we're alone  
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna' go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

(I waited for a girl like you)  
  
The light shines  
It's getting hot on my shoulder  
I don't mind,  
This time it doesn't matter  
'Cause your friends,  
They look good and you look better  
  
Don't you know all night I've been waiting for a girl like you to come around,
'round, 'round?  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look, yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
I'm weaker  
My worlds fall and they hit the ground  
Oh life, come on head, don't you fail me now?  
I start to say,  
"I think I love you", but I make no sound  
  
You know 'cause all my life, I've been waiting for a girl like you to come
around  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look, yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
There is no other place that I would rather be  
Than right here with you tonight  
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you  
And we can stay here tonight  
'Cause there's so much that I wanna say, I wanna say  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
  
With just one look, yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
I waited for a girl like you


[Harry:]  
Written in these walls  
Are the stories that I can't explain  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here empty for days  
  
[Liam:]  
She told me in the morning  
She don't feel the same about us in her bones  
It seems to me, that when I die  
These words will be written on my stone  
  
[Zayn:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The ground beneath my feet is open wide  
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight  
With nothing in between  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life, I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke, inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Niall:]  
Written on these walls are  
The colors that I can't change  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here in it's cage  
  
[Liam:]  
I know that in the morning,  
I'll see us in the light upon a hill  
Although I am broken,  
My heart is untamed, still  
  
[Louis:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight  
With nothing in between  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life, I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke, inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Zayn:]  
And I've been waiting for this time to come around  
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds  
  
[Niall:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)  
I spend her love until she's broke (until she's broke inside)  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life


My hands, your hands  
Tied up like two ships  
  
Drifting, weightless  
Waves try to break it  
I'd do anything to save it  
Why is it so hard to say it?  
  
My heart, your heart  
Sit tight like book ends  
  
Pages between us  
Written with no end  
So many words we're not saying  
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone  
You make me strong  
  
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don't care,  
I'm not scared of love  
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong  
That you make me strong?  
  
Think of how much  
Love that's been wasted  
  
People always  
Trying to escape it  
Move on to stop their heart breaking  
But there's nothing I'm running from  
You make me strong  
  
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don't care,  
I'm not scared of love  
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong?  
  
So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh, oh  
Need you to keep me from falling apart  
I'll always hold on  
'Cause you make me strong  
  
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don't care  
I'm not scared of love  
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong?  
  
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don't care,  
I'm not scared of love  
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong  
That you make me strong?  
  
I'm sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don't care,  
I'm not scared of love  
'Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong  
That you make me strong


Yeah, oh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh  
  
Can't believe you're packing your bags  
Trying so hard not to cry  
Had the best time and now it's the worst time  
But we have to say goodbye  
  
Don't promise that you're gonna write  
Don't promise that you'll call  
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
  
Wish that we could be alone now  
If we could find some place to hide  
Make the last time just like the first time  
Push a button and rewind  
  
Don't say the word that's on your lips  
Don't look at me that way  
Just promise you'll remember  
When the sky is grey  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
  
So please don't make this any harder  
We can't take this any farther  
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
You always will be my summer love


I got my first real six-string  
Bought it at the five-and-dime  
Played it till my fingers bled  
Was the summer of '69  
  
Me and some guys from school  
Had a band and we tried real hard  
Jimmy quit, Jody got married  
Shoulda known, we'd never get far  
  
Oh when I look back now  
That summer seemed to last forever  
And if I had the choice  
Yeah, I'd always want to be there  
Those were the best days of my life  
  
Oh when I look back now  
That summer seemed to last forever  
And if I had the choice  
Yeah, I'd always want to be there  
Those were the best days of my life


I got a lot on my plate  
So get off of my bag  
My worries are piling up  
And multiplying  
  
Ain't got a lot on  
My name and it disappears fast  
Well I should spend less  
I know I know I'm trying  
  
I can't afford to change myself  
For sleep almost every night  
So I should plan my  
Week accordingly so  
I'll feel alright  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
No I can not afford rent or to  
Call it I drive but I still got  
Champagne to help me not remember  
  
Sitting on a tall fence looking  
Down at both sides well I think  
I should just stay put and a have  
A fucking dinner. It's like all I do  
Just when I do when I need a friend  
  
Who ses I can't have everything  
I want and still eat my cake  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
Whenever hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older


Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me  
Now that I'm with somebody else  
You tell me you love me  
I slept on your doorstep  
Begging for one chance  
Now that I finally moved on  
You say that you missed me all along  
  
[Chorus]  
Who do you think you are?  
Who do you think I am?  
You only love to see me breaking  
You only want me 'cause I'm taken  
You don't really want my heart  
No, you just like to know you can  
Still be the one who gets it breaking  
You only want me when I'm taken  
  
You're messing with my head  
Girl that's what you do best  
Saying there's nothing you won't do  
To get me to say yes  
You're impossible to resist  
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it  
It's like I'm finally awake  
And you're just a beautiful mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for showing me  
Who you are underneath  
No, thank you, I don't need  
Another heartless misery  
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous  
And I know that you hate to hear this  
But this is not about you anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me


Can't ever get it right  
No matter how hard I try  
And I've tried  
Well I put up a good fight  
But your words cut like knives  
And I'm tired  
As you break my heart again this time  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Well you're the charming type  
That little twinkle in your eye  
Gets me every time  
And well there must have been a time  
I was the reason for that smile  
Keep in mind  
As you take what's left of you and I  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie


Another night I'm waiting for you  
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn  
It's you I am looking for  
Another night of summer passes  
Wide awake I'm waiting for you patiently  
I want something more...  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want me  
  
Tell me why can't you just tell me  
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me?  
I'm stronger than you know  
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment  
I'm sure what you're looking for  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want you  
  
Remember last November  
When I met you in the rain  
Remember what you told me  
Are you feeling still the same  
Did you tell the truth then  
Or was it just another game  
Tell me (x3)


There was a time  
I was everything and nothing all in one  
When you found me  
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun  
  
I need to tell you  
How you light up every second of the day  
But in the moonlight  
You just shine like a beacon on the bay  
  
And I can't explain  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside  
And I can't describe  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
The way you look tonight  
The way you look tonight


You tell me that you're sad and lost your way  
You tell me that your tears are here to stay  
But I know you're only hiding  
And I just wanna see you  
  
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain  
And I can see your head is held in shame,  
But I just wanna see you smile again  
See you smile again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you  
And I'll be here for you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
I wish that I could take you to the stars  
I'd never let you fall and break your heart  
And if you wanna cry or fall apart  
I'll be there to hold you  
  
You tell me that you hurt, it's all in vain  
But I can see your heart can love again  
And I remember you laughing  
So let's just laugh again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you, back to you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
And you don't need  
You don't need to worry  
And you will see it's easy to be loved  
I know you wanna be loved  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down  
We will find a way through the dark


Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
Flying in the wind  
With the sun to our backs  
We can't see the shadows  
And we can't go back  
  
Cause  
  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
They can say what they want  
They can say what they feel  
But they can't change the way that the I want  
And the way this love is real  
  
Oh tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I adore you  
I love you oh  
Tonight is gonna be perfect if you're by my side  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because you're making me smile.


Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and  
You're never coming round  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of  
Listening to the sound of my tears  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that  
The best of all the years have gone by  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified  
And then I see the look in your eyes  
Nial y Louis:  
(Turn around, bright eyes)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I fall apart  
  
Niall y Louis:

Todos:  
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever  
And if you only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never  
Be wrong  
Together we can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
  
(Niall: all of the time)  
  
Todos:  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Louis y Liam:  
Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only  
Falling apart  
  
Zayn:  
There's nothing I can do... A total eclipse of the heart


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I've been roaming around,  
I was looking down at all I see  
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach  
  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak  
Countless lovers undercover of the streets  
  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah  
  
Someone like you  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep  
Waging wars to shape, the poet and the beat  
  
I hope it's going to make you notice  
I hope it's going to make you notice  
  
Someone like me  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like me  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) someone like me  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now  
I'm ready now,  
  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now,  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now  
  
One, two, three, four

Somebody  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
I've been running around, I was looking down at all I see


There once was a group with Liam and Niall  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Did you know Harry's such a slob?  
He needs to win X Factor 'cause he can't get a job  
And Oh, Louis needs a boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
'Cause he's got no other clothes  
They really need your vote  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad  
Vas Happenin' mum? Vas Happenin' Mick?  
  
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad  
Vas Happenin' song? Vas Happenin' sad?  
  
And Zayn's the master of echoes  
And Niall was raised by leprechauns  
So he won't ever grow  
And Oh, Louis needs that boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
And it's becoming a joke  
They really need your vote  
  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?


Liam: I used to rule the world seas would rise when I  
Gave the word now in the morning I sleep alone sweep the  
Streets that I used to own.  
Zayn: I used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemies  
Eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is  
Dead long live the king  
All: I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing roman cavalry  
Choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and sheald my  
Missionaries in a foriegn field


[Verse 1: Liam]  
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire  
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light  
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies  
There's no question, she's not in a disguise  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I can't hold you, too close now  
Through the wire, through the wire  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire  
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine  
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?  
Tell me now, am I running out of time?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I can't hold you too close now  
Through the wire, through the wire  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now, I wish I could be there now


I know you want, know you wanna take it slow  
Think about all the places we could go  
If you give in tonight  
Just let me set you free  
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Say the word, say the word but don't say no  
Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes  
The secret's safe with me  
There's no right time or place  
'Cause anyone can see we'll do it anyway  
  
'Cause we got all night  
We're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away  
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah  
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high  
I wanna be addicted, don't say no  
Just let go  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
With me, with me  
Why don't you go there with me?


Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda, somehow, realized what you gotta do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
And all the roads we have to walk are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would like to say to you  
But I don't know how  
  
Because maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall  
  
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you've got to do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
I said maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall


[Verse 1]  
[Niall]  
I figured it out  
I figured out from black and white  
Seconds and hours  
Maybe we had to take some time  
  
[Liam]  
I know how it goes  
I know how it goes from wrong and right  
Silence and sound  
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us?  
  
Did they ever fight, like us?  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us  
No, nothing can come between You and I  
  
Oh, you and I  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Zayn]  
I figured it out  
Saw the mistakes of up and down  
Meet in the middle  
There's always room for common ground  
  
[Louis]  
I see what it's like  
I see what it's like for day and night  
Never together  
'Cause they see things in a different light, like us  
  
But they never tried, like us  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
[Zayn]  
'Cause you and I!!!  
  
[Chorus]  
[All]  
We don't want to be like them,  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between  
You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
No, nothing can come between  
You and I  
Oh, You and I  
You and I  
  
[Outro]  
We can make it if we try  
You and I  
Oh  
You and I


You're insecure  
Don't know what for  
You're turning you're head when you walk through the do-o-or  
Don't need make up  
To cover up  
Being the way that you are is eno-o-ough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby,you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell yo don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful  
  
So cc-come on you got it wrong  
To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong  
I don't know why you're being shy  
And turn away when I look into you're ey-ey-eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you,yeah  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful!


Maybe it's the way she walked (Wow)  
Straight into my heart and stole it  
Through the doors and past the guards (Wow),  
Just like she already owned it  
  
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
Said her name was Georgia Rose, (Wow)  
And her daddy was a dentist  
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)  
But she kissed me like she meant it  
  
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,  
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you, (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced how we danced  
How we danced how we danced (1, 2, 1, 2, 3)  
  
How we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever (We danced, we danced, it
goes something like, yeah)  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember

I think it goes oh  
  
Best song ever,  
It was the best song ever  
It was the best song ever,  
It was the best song ever


The end of the night  
We should say goodbye  
But we carry on  
While everyone's gone  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind  
  
Lean in when you laugh  
We take photographs  
There's no music on  
But we dance along  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night

Baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind

We'll do it all  
Everything  
On our own  
We don't need  
Anything  
Or anyone  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
I don't quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  
Those three words  
Are said too much  
They're not enough  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
Let's waste time  
Chasing cars  
Around our heads  
I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
All that I am  
All that I ever was  
Is here in your perfect eyes  
They're all I can see  
I don't know where  
Confused about how as well  
Just know that these things  
Will never change for us at all  
If I lay here  
If I just lay her  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?


Been a lot of places  
I've been all around the world  
Seen a lot of faces  
Never knowing where I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know  
I know the sun will be rising  
Back home  
  
Living out of cases,  
Packing up and taking off  
Made a lot of changes  
But not forgetting who I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know,  
I know the moon will be rising  
Back home  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
I've been away for ages  
But I've got everything I need  
I'm flicking through the pages  
I've written in my memory  
  
I feel like I'm dreaming  
Oh, so I know, I know, I know,  
I know that I'm never leaving  
No, I won't go  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Lights off when they should be on  
Even stars and skies above  
Short days when the nights are long  
When I think of the days I've gone  
Don't matter how far I've gone  
I'll always be around oh  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
Never, never  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Home  
Don't forget it  
Home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Never forget it  
This song  
Don't forget it!  
No, I never forget it  
This song  
You were never


[Verse 1: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
Down  
Ever since you came around  
Everybody wanna drag us down  
Is it cause we look too happy?  
I'll never forget when you looked at me  
And told me it was all mine  
I remember that, like yesterday  
It was a summer night on the west side  
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah  
We crossed paths like an intersection  
Now we both headed in one direction  
  
[Chorus: Liam and All]  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
  
[Verse 2: Harry]  
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark  
You've never seen it look so easy  
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat  
Baby you're my only reason  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left  
The shell of a man who could never be his best  
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun  
You taught me how to be someone, yeah  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody, nobody  
Nobody, nobody  
  
[Verse 4: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
She a work of art like Van Gogh  
I'm underground like Camp Lo  
Yeah I'm top of them pop charts  
But I'm still saggin' my pants low  
I don't do meetings, I cancel  
One D let me get some of them fans though  
Just a young nigga from Dade County  
Where they move chickens like Nando  
When I touch down in London town  
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell  
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down  
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down


I'm thinking of you tonight  
And there's nothing that I want more  
Than to be by your side  
And let you grab so tight to me  
As you whisper the words good night to me  
Late at night  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
Your heart is fixing me  
Without saying anything  
My worries fall like rain  
As these melodies run through your veins  
Let me take you far - just hold onto me  
  
And we'll take this world and you will see  
That in the end, I'll be there for you  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
There's a sunshine floating  
I see clearly now  
So clearly now  
There's so much more  
That I hoped I'd ever find  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake


My minds at erase  
And my thoughts are done  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
Since my lies begun  
The way I feel inside  
Reflects of the souls in your eyes  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
All of my life  
To think of who I am  
Shows much of what you were too  
Slowly I realize  
I'll be fine without you  
I gave you your chances  
And you just put them aside  
To find out too late  
Of who I am inside  
  
Show me yourself come show me who you are  
These are the times we wish it never went this far  
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see  
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly  
Give me your heart to come and be in one  
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run  
Just as we laughed, kissed I looked deep in your eyes  
To tell you how I felt, came one without reply  
  
Echos is all I hear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go is all I fear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go  
I can't let go  
So fall away is what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do


[Verse 1]  
  
[Harry]  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
Something deep inside me I can't give up  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
  
[Niall]  
I'm feeling something deep inside  
Hotter than the dead stream burning up  
I got a feeling deep inside  
It's taking, it's taking all I've got  
Yeah, it's taking, its taking all I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
Cos nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
Maybe we're fireproof  
  
[Liam]  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Louis]  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
Riding on a wind and I won't give up  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
You must be fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Bridge]  
[All]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
  
[Outro]  
  
[Zayn]  
It's been so long it's been so long  
  
[Harry]  
Maybe we're fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do


[Liam]  
Let's dance in style,  
Let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,  
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
[Harry]  
Let us die young or let us live forever,  
We don't have the power but we never say never,  
Sitting in a sandpit,  
Life is a short trip,  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever,  
Forever young?  
  
[Niall]  
Some are like water, some are like the heat,  
Some are a melody and some are the beat,  
But sooner or later they all will be gone,  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
[Harry]  
It's hard to get old without a cause,  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,  
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[Liam]  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play,  
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,  
We let 'em come true.  
  
[Harry]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever (forever),  
Forever young...  
[Fades]


In Mullingar, Westmeath born and raised  
At Nando's, is where I spent most of my days  
Chilling out, Maxing, Relaxing all cool then I go eat  
Some chicken outside the school.  
When a couple of chavs, they were up to no good  
They started making trouble in my neighborhood.  
I got in one little fight and my mom started objectin'  
She said "Your moving to London and joining one direction.  
I made it through auditions, thanks to Katy Perry  
And that's where I met Lou, Zayn, Liam, and Harry.  
And now who would've thought that we've come this far!  
I'm sure as hell not going back to Mullingar.


[Verse 1: Liam]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn] Am I the only  
Only believer?  
[All Members]  
(Da da da da)  
There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
  
[Verse 1: Louis Tomlinson]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Niall Horan]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
[Louis Tomlinson]  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]

Only believer?  
[All Members]  
(Da da da da)  
There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you


[Liam:]  
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed  
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart  
I tore it apart  
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence  
And no woman in the world deserves this  
But here I am asking you for one more chance  
  
[Harry:]  
Can we fall, one more time?  
Stop the tape and rewind  
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade  
Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Liam:]  
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles  
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was  
You've almost had enough  
And your actions speak louder than words  
And you're about to break from all you've heard  
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where  
  
[Zayn:]  
I'll be here, by your side  
No more fears, no more crying  
But if you walk away  
I know I'll fade  
'Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Zayn:]  
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more time  
I'll make it better  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more  
Can we try one more time to make it all better?  
  
[Harry:]  
'Cause it's gotta be you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you


So your friend's been telling me  
You've been sleeping with my sweater  
And that you can't stop missing me  
Bet my friend's been telling you  
I'm not doing much better  
'Cause I'm missing half of me  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Forget all we said that night  
No, it doesn't even matter  
'Cause we both got split in two  
If you could spare an hour or so,  
We'll go for lunch down by the river  
We can really talk it through  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
'Cause I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Half a heart without you,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Though I try to get you out of my head  
The truth is I got lost without you  
And since then I've been waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Without you, without you, half a heart without you  
Without you, without you, I'm half a heart without you


Baby, you got me sick  
I don't know what I did  
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah  
  
Got your voice in my head  
Saying let's just be friends  
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Baby, now that you're gone  
I can't stand dumb love songs  
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah  
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see  
How you messed me up, I'm better off now  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Every time you look like that  
You're giving me a heart attack  
'Cause seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
You're all I ever wanted  
Every time you look like that  
You're all I ever wanted  
You're giving me a heart attack


[Verse 1: Liam]  
Make a little conversation  
So long I've been waiting  
To let go of myself and feel alive  
  
[Niall]  
So many nights I thought it over  
Told myself I kind of liked her  
But there was something missing in her eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
So hot that I couldn't take it  
Want to wake up and see your face  
And remember how good it was being here last night  
  
[Louis]  
Still high with a little feeling  
I see the smile as it starts to creep in  
It was there, I saw it in your eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Harry]  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[All]  
It's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home

I keep playing it inside my head,  
All that you said to me.  
I lie awake just to convince myself,  
This wasn't just a dream.  
  
'Cause you were right here,  
And I should've taken the chance.  
But I got so scared,  
And I lost the moment again.  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I can't believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
Every morning when I leave my house,  
I always look for you.  
Yeah, I see you every time I close my eyes,  
What am I gonna go?  
  
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight  
But in my eyes i saw how you're looking at me  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away  
When we were dancing, and you looked up at me  
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way  
If I could replay I would never have let you go  
No, oh, never have let you go  
Am I out of time?  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should have kissed you


[Verse 1: Harry]  
I wanna write you a song  
One that's beautiful as you are sweet  
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone  
I wanna write you a song  
  
[Verse 1: Liam]  
I wanna lend you my coat  
One that's as soft as your cheek  
So when the world is cold you'll have a hiding place you can go  
I wanna lend you my coat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
I wanna build you a boat  
One that's strong as you are free  
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't  
I wanna build you a boat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 3: Niall]  
I wanna write you a song  
One to make your heart remember me  
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along  
I wanna write you a song, I wanna write you a song


Lately I found myself thinking  
Been dreaming about you a lot  
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend  
But that's one thing you've already got  
  
He drives to school every morning  
While I walk alone in the rain  
He'd kill me without any warning  
If he took a look in my brain  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would, I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Back in my head we were kissing  
I thought things were going alright  
With a sign on my back saying kick me  
Reality ruined my life  
  
Feels like I'm constantly playing  
A game that I'm destined to lose  
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend  
He's got 27 tattoos  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then  
I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
I would, I would yeah.


Tell me you believe in love  
It's not an illusion...  
  
[Verse 1: Liam:]  
I've been thinking about the nights  
And the dangerous tricks people play on the eyes of the innocent  
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke  
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them  
  
[Hook: Harry]  
But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall  
I'm all that you need tonight  
I would never turn your heart into broken parts  
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes  
  
[Hook: Louis]  
Can't you see it? I'm not trying to mislead you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Bridge: Niall]  
You can tie me up in chains  
You can throw away the key  
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave  
You're the truth I can't explain  
You're the only one I see  
It's not an illusion to me  
  
[Chorus: All]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion


Well you done done me and you bet I felt it  
I tried to beat you but you're so hot that I melted  
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back  
  
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait, I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love  
  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  
We're just one big family, and  
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved  
  
So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure  
There's no need to complicate, our time is short  
This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do  
But do you want to come on  
Scooch on over closer dear  
And I will nibble your ear  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and laughed  
  
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Come on and open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours  
  
So please don't, please don't, please don't  
There's no need to complicated  
Cause our time is short  
This is, this is, this is our fate, I'm yours!


[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Down to Earth  
Keep on falling when I know it hurts  
Going faster than a million miles an hour  
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow  
Down to Earth  
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns  
Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round  
Moving in reverse with no way out  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Eyes can't shine  
Unless there's something burning bright behind  
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine  
I feel myself running out of time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity


Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright ligths the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
We're the kids  
We're the kids  
We're the kids in America  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.

Girl, it should be me  
Driving to your house  
Knocking on your door  
Kissing you on the mouth  
Holding on your hand  
Dancing in the dark  
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start  
  
But now when I see you with him it  
Tears my world apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most,  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first (I loved you first, loved you first)  
  
Girl, it should be me  
Calling on your phone  
Saying you're the one, and that I'll never let you go  
I never understood, what love was really like,  
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes  
But now when I see you with him  
My whole world falls apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
The first touch  
The first kiss  
First girl to make me feel like this  
Heartbreak  
It's killing me  
I loved you first, why can't you see?  
  
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken

I'm gonna make a change,  
For once in my life  
It's gonna feel real good,  
Gonna make a diference  
Gonna make it right...  
  
As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets,  
With not enought to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs  
  
A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know  
  
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you wanna make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change  
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)


Guess this means you're sorry  
You're standing at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said you'd never come back  
But here you are again  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

'Cause when we think we've got it right  
  
We go  
Na na na


I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Yeah, I know it's hard to remember that they tried out separately  
It's even harder to picture, they placed at number 3  
Harry loves to get naked, but the boys never mind  
As soon as they got famous, all the fan girls broke down  
Twitcams make me smile  
Someone should tell Niall to hide his profile  
I'd let Larry Stylinson prank call my friends  
Six are: s in Terrance  
Zayn's no pedophile  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Everytime I read a new fanfic  
Louis munching on some carrot sticks  
Why is Harry's hair always perfect?  
Liam's only got 1 kidney left  
Yeah, we better thank Simon Cowell for making the boys stay  
Louis drove the van so slow  
They got stopped twice that day  
Zayn has such beautiful eyes  
And perfectly coiffed hair  
There are women in Sweden  
Who wouldn't put their shirts down  
Video diaries  
Superman Louis  
Liam love Danielle Pea-zer and  
Zayn loves Perrie  
Niall and his guitar  
Louis and Eleanor  
The kazoo and Harry  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Zayn should probably work on his dance moves  
Niall is a big fan of the zoo  
Harry used to share a flat with Lou  
Liam won't go near another spoon  
Now I'm at a Nando's


[Verse 1: Liam]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]

Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again

Never enough, it's never enough, never enough

Come on, come on  
  
[Bridge]  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it

I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on


In West Philadelphia I was born and raised  
On the playground is where I spent most of my days  
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,  
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school  
  
When a couple of guys who where up to no good  
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bell air".


You're insecure,  
Don't know what for,  
You're turning heads when you walk through the door,  
Don't need make-up, to cover up,  
Being the way that you are is enough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
So come on, you got it wrong,  
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song,  
I don't know why, you're being shy,  
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
(Na na na na na na na)  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful


[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one  
Standing out from the list of the things I've done  
All the rest of my crimes don't come close  
To the look on your face when I let you go  
So I built you a house from a broken home  
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke  
It took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue  
Is at the top of the list of the things I want  
Mind is running in circles of you and me  
Anyone in between is the enemy  
  
[Verse 3: Harry Styles]  
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from  
Love was something you never heard enough  
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Bridge: Harry Styles]  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Tell me where you're hiding out  
Where do broken hearts go  
  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go  
Tell me cause I'm ten feet down  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go


It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money, but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that  
I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while  
I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
