Baby I got love for thee  
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start  
I love you more than anything  
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby (Ooh oh)  
  
Baby I'm so down for you  
No matter what you do (real talk) I'll be around  
Oh baby, see baby I been feelin' you  
Before I even knew what feelings were about  
Oh baby  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby  
  
Straight up, you got me  
All in, how could I not be  
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)  
If it's even possible, I love you more  
Than word love can say it  
It's better not explaining that's why I keep saying baby I  
  
Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby (baby)  
Baby, baby (baby I)  
Ooh baby oh baby oh baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby  
(Baby I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby


[Verse 1]  
If you want it, take it  
I should have said it before  
Tried to hide it, fake it  
I can't pretend anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
You were better, deeper  
I was under a spell  
Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell  
  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Bridge]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
(Our love baby, oooh)  
The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more


If you were mine, boy! There would no be no moon or sun, because I'm truly  
In love with you and me and my girls don't know what-to-do oh oh oh  
See it wasn't that cool, we was just chilin at the pool  
And my homegirl said girl, is there any why we can for a twirl  
But things got kinda heavy so we jumped into my new chevy and  
That's when I seen the new boy from the team Hey, man it's me  
Direct contact aint a thing I could do, I'm too shy but you make me wanna  
Cry but that's not what I'm used too, if you were mine, boy! There would be  
No moon or sun, because I'm truly in love with you and me and my girls don't  
Know what-to-do oh oh oh, should I make contact? No, don't do that  
So I'll probably leave until my heart says I can't take no more, never felt  
Like this before. Direct contact ah ah ah no more.


(Hahaha) lalala uhuh  
Been runnin' 'round in circles  
Tryin' to find the end (end)  
Bumped into this shy guy  
While chillin' with my friends (friends)  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, you got me open  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
Crazy what we're doin'  
Livin' lettin' go  
Ridin' havin' good times  
And no one has to know  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
We got that jam, make them dance  
Make them lose their mi-i-i-i-inds x4  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x4


I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us,  
Ahead of us, yeah.  
Uh I'm ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
'Cause that could be the death of us,  
The death of us,  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
Hey, What happened to the butterflies  
Guess they didn't count at that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it  
Well that's when we start turnin' around  
You're saying baby don't worry  
But we're still going the wrong way baby  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
They say only fools fall in love  
Well they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like, I've been here before  
Ah  
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right  
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know  
Yeah, we can find our way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
My baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy  
Can we get back to the way it was  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decide not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in  
Traffic, I'm under  
Pressure  
Pressure  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on  
Honeymoon Avenue

[Verse 1]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
I don't ever ask you where you've been  
And I don't feel the need to  
Know who you're with  
I can't even think straight but I can tell  
That you were just with her  
And I'll still be a fool  
I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't ever tell you how I really feel  
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean  
And nothing's ever easy  
That's what they say  
I know I'm not your only  
But I'll still be a fool  
Cause I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, (Just a little bit) oh, oh (Hallelujah)  
  
[Bridge]  
(Just a little bit, oh yeah)  
I know I'm not you're only  
But at least I'm one  
I hear a little love is better than none  
Oh babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit baby)  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Verse 1]  
Every day I'm grindin'  
I don't even get a weekend  
Been livin' my life  
In black and white, no sleeping  
So tonight I'm gonna flip it  
Like in a New York minute  
We're gonna hail a cab  
And don't look back  
Once we get in it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say

In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne

Don't need no guest list  
Everybody's invited  
I said even if you can't get in  
We'll dance outside it  
We're gonna make this bubble  
Carbonate some trouble  
When the night gets black  
Gotta take it back to another level  
  
Lemme hear you say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh

This for my number one girl who got the top spot title  
Spent a hour in the bathroom walked out looking like a model  
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo  
On the moon, Who needs genies in a bottle girl  
If they already got you  
  
Boy you make me feel so lucky

And to give you this heart of mine

Now if all fell through it  
Would you catch me before the pavement  
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation  
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting  
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary  
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary  
My black book, and numbers thicker than the dictionary  
And bible I got to recycle

Five course meals even though you don't mind a drive-thru

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]  
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars  
And I try to believe we'll find a way  
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?  
(Major Lazer)  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside  
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?  
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?  
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]  
Only love will make us ache  
Only love is worth the chase  
All my love, I know we're waiting for this  
On the rocks upon the mountain tops

All my love  
All my love  
All my love  
Up on the mountain top

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say  
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game

Sun in the brightest sky

I'd like to say we gave it a try  
I'd like to blame it all on life  
Maybe we just weren't right,  
But that's a lie,  
That's a lie  
  
And we can deny it as much as we want  
But in time our feelings will show  
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough  
  
If I could change the world overnight  
There'd be no such thing as goodbye  
You'll be standing right where you were  
And we'd get the chance we deserve  
  
Try to deny it as much as you want  
But in time our feelings will show  
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you, oh  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough  
  
(Huh) oh, huh oh  
(Oh baby) hmm  
(You know) oh  
(You know baby)  
(Almost)  
  
Baby baby baby (is not enough baby)  
  
(You know) huh huh  
(Huh yeah)  
  
And we can deny it as much as we want  
But in time our feelings will show  
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough (is never in enough babe)  
(We were) so close to being in love (So close)  
If I would have known that you wanted me (that you wanted me)  
The way I wanted you, babe  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we we almost  
We almost knew what love was (baby)  
But almost is never enough  
  
(Huh)  
(Oh baby) almost  
(You know) hey  
(You know baby)  
(Almost)  
(Is never enough baby) never  
(At all)  
(Hey ey ey)

Baby you just gotta make up your mind  
We decided  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright, ooh baby  
We're gonna be alright  
We're gonna be alright


I told you once, "Get out my life.  
I don't need ya, I'll be alright."  
But some things are better left unsaid (said said)  
So tell the truth, and hit me hard  
A broken heart is all I have now, but  
Some things are better left unsaid (said said)  
  
And I swore that I would never say  
I miss you more every day  
But some things are better left unsaid  
Are better left unsaid  
Said  
Said  
  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

Put your hands up put your hands up  
Don't play me just kiss me.  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh  
Tonight I'll say ?  
Don't play me just kiss me, babe  
  
You tell a lie, plan tonight  
Too many drinks  
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid  
  
And I swore that I would never say  
I miss you more every day  
But some things are better left unsaid  
Are better left unsaid,  
Said  
Said  
  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

Riding 'round in my Cadillac  
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change  
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you, you  
  
Summer days with my honey  
Worrying about nothing  
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze  
Who knew that kiss was the last one  
I never thought we would change  
Baby, I'm missing you  
  
We should have been forever but we fell apart  
Might have separated but you took my heart  
Always knew I wasn't really over us  
Sometimes I catch myself  
  
Riding 'round in my Cadillac  
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change  
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you, you  
  
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget  
Made everything from nothing cause time was always spent  
  
We should have been forever but we fell apart  
Might have separated but you took my heart  
Always knew I wasn't really over us  
Sometimes I catch myself  
  
Riding 'round in my Cadillac  
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change  
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you, you


[Verse 1]  
Don't need permission  
Made my decision to test my limits  
Cause it's my business, God as my witness  
Start what I finished  
Don't need no hold up  
Taking control of this kind of moment  
I'm locked and loaded  
Completely focused, my mind is open  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God  
Don't ya stop, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you  
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout  
  
[Verse 2]  
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and  
Know what I'm doing  
The way we're movin' like introducing  
Us to a new thing  
I wanna savor, save it for later  
To taste the flavor, cause I'm a taker  
Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature  
I live for danger  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God  
Don't ya stop, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman  
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

Say you love me, as much as I love you, yeah  
Would you hurt me baby?  
Would you do this to me? Yeah  
Would you lie to me baby?  
Cause the truth hurts so much more  
  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?  
Leave my heart still at the door

Are there any rules?  
  
If this is a lesson  
Baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you

To give me all your love is all I ever had cause what

Throw my hands on a blade for ya

[Verse 1]  
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before  
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more  
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be  
But if I can't be me, then fuck's the point? No...  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care about it anymore, oh  
I don't care about it anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me  
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold  
Like what you think and what he thinks and what they think  
But I love me  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care about it anymore, oh  
I don't care about it anymore  
  
[Outro: Harmonization]  
Yeah  
I-i-i-  
I-i-i don't care about it anymore  
I-i-i don't care about it anymore


[Verse 1]  
Yeah, you really tried  
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy  
All the shit you've done  
You can't outrun the way you understand me  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale  
You don't even care  
You focused your frustration on a small detail  
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why should I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
And I'm taking it right back  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all  
No slave to your decision, ooh  
Gotta find a way to break the spell  
To get the hell away from those who block my vision  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey  
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line  
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why would I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
I'm taking it right back, baby  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why should I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
And I'm taking it right back, hey  
Taking it right back, baby  
I'm taking it right back, hey


Hey sister, go sister, soul sister

Struttin' her stuff on the street  
She said, "hello, hey joe

The colour of cafe au lait  
Made the savage beast inside  
Roaring till it cried  
Ye ye ye ye yeah

On the first page of our story  
The future seemed so bright  
Then this thing turned out so evil  
Don't know why I'm still surprised  
  
Even Angels have their wicked schemes  
And you take that to new extremes  
But you'll always be my hero  
Even though you've lost you're mind  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie  
  
Now there's gravel in our voices  
Glass is shattered from the fight  
In this tug of war you'll always win  
Even when I'm right  
  
'Cause you feed me fables from your hands  
With violent words and empty threats  
And it's sick that all these battles  
Are what keeps me satisfied  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie  
  
So maybe I'm a masochist  
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave  
'Til these walls are goin' up  
In smoke with all our memories  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie  
I love the way you lie  
Ohh I love the way you lie.

Not hard (It's not hard)  
It's not hard (It's not hard)  
It's not hard (It's not hard)  
It's not hard (It's not hard)

In the end, you found out that my heart was better  
Real hard (Real hard)  
It's so hard (So hard)  
Real hard (Real hard)  
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio

Makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and

[Verse 1]  
I was a liar, I gave into the fire  
I know I should've fought it  
At least I'm being honest  
Feel like a failure cause I know that I failed you  
I should've done you better cause you don't want a liar  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I know, and I know  
And I know she gives you everything, but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know  
And I know that you got everything but I got nothing here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
One more time, I promise after that I'll let you go  
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart  
All I really care is you wake up in my arms  
So One last time I need to be the one who takes you home  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it  
But stay with me a minute: I'll swear I'll make it worth it  
Can't you forgive me, at least just temporarily?  
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I know, and I know  
And I know she gives you everything, but boy I couldn't give it to you  
And I know, and I know, and I know That you got everything  
But I got nothing here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
So one last time I need to be the one who takes you home

I want you, I want you  
I want you, I want you  
I want you, I want you  
  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
Let me introduce myself  
  
Lookin' in your eyes makes me wonder how  
I got so much time with you and there's more around  
I know all the competition that's after you  
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?  
  
That we're living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
Baby, oh, it's hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
That's how I know  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
As I'm layin' down with you every night  
It still gets to me that you remain by my side  
I ain't saying that I'm not deservin' of you  
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when  
  
I wished for living  
In a fairytale no malice and no lies  
So, baby, oh, it's hard to believe  
All the love you have inside is only mine  
That's how I know  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
I can't be your only one  
No, I can't be your only one  
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met  
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?  
No, I can't  
  
Only 1  
Be your only 1  
Only 1

Lemme see you put your hearts up, yeah lemme see you put your hearts up, yeah  
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world  
  
You think you're so small  
Like you're itty bitty.  
Just one match in the lights of the city  
Walking by strangers on the side of the street  
Like a quarter in a cup'll get 'em off on their feet, like  
You think you're never gonna make your mark  
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like  
Out of sight out of mind, like, like

Can't resurrect ghandi

[Verse 1]  
There's a fire starting in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me outta the dark  
Finally I can see you crystal clear  
Go ahead and sell me out  
And I'll lay your ship there  
  
See how I leave with every piece of you  
Don't under estimate the things that I would do  
There's a fire starting in my heart in my heart  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me outta the dark  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
The scars of your love remind me of us  
The keep me thinkin' that we could've had it all  
The scars of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
We should've had it a-a-a-all  
Rollin' in the de-e-ep  
You had my heart and so-o-o-oul ya had it  
And you played it to the be-e-e-eat  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby I have no story to be told  
But I've heard one on you  
And I'm gonna make your head burn  
Think of me in the depths of your despair  
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
The scars of your love  
Remind me of us  
They leave me thinkin' that we could've had it all  
The scars o-of your love they leave me breathless  
I can't help feelin'  
  
[Chorus]  
We could've had it a-a-a-all  
Rollin' in the de-e-ep  
You had my heart and so-o-o-oul ya had it  
And ya played it to the de-e-e-ep  
And you played it to the be-e-e-eat  
Mmmhmmm


[Intro]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa Tell Me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 1]  
Feeling Christmas all around  
And I'm trying to play it cool  
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room  
Let It Snow is blasting now  
But I won't get it in the mood  
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been down this road before  
Fell in love on Christmas night  
But I knew you say I woke up and you wasn't by my side  
Now I need someone to hold  
Be my fire in the cold  
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love  
That he thinks of  
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh  
On the 25th by the fireplace ooh  
But I don't want no broken heart  
This year I've got to be smart  
  
Oh baby  
Santa tell me  
Santa tell me  
Santa tell me  
If he will be here  
  
[Chorus]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year  
  
[Outro]  
Santa tell me if you're really there  
Don't make me fall in love again  
If he won't be here next year  
Santa tell me if he really cares  
Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year


[Verse:]  
Dear Santa  
It's me Ariana  
I know it's been awhile but I really need  
Your help this year  
Let me make this clear  
See I really love him  
And it's been kinda tough cause  
He's only in town for the holidays  
Tomorrow he's flying away  
Away from me  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I don't need another gift  
I just have one wish  
This year can you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just make it snow in california  
I'll even settle for rain  
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace  
Will be the perfect gift  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In Calif-orn-i-a  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Dear Santa  
What happened to the plan we had  
I checked the news and it said  
It'd be a sunny day  
Make it go away  
See I I really need him to stay  
For a couple more days  
Can't you make his  
Five o'clock flight delay  
Won't you find a way  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I don't need another gift  
I just have one wish  
This year can you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just make it snow in california  
I'll even settle for rain  
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace  
Will be the perfect gift  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In Calif-orn-i-a  
  
[Bridge:]  
I know I'm asking for the impossible  
But I believe in miracles  
I need my baby right here with me  
So please, please  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just make it snow in california  
I'll even settle for rain  
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning  
Give me something to make him stay  
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace  
Will be the perfect gift  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
Let it snow  
In Calif-orn-i-a

[Verse 1]  
I've never been so caught up  
Still so into us  
I never thought I'd be here  
Should've turned to dust  
Ooh, let's be honest, baby  
This is so unusual  
Ooh, and I'm not tempted, baby  
Even if they're beautiful  
I used to be cautious  
A little too reckless  
Now all my emotions  
Are all cause of you  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere  
I don't even see it down the road  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
Not even sometimes

Ooh, let's be honest, baby  
This is so unusual

It used to be easy  
For someone to steal me

Are all cause of you, boy  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go

[Bridge]  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
Why it never worked, but it's going to now  
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know  
What it does to me when I feel you around  
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?  
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there  
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there  
Hard to breathe when you're not here  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go  
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere  
I don't even see it down the road  
Cause we're collectin' moments  
Tattoos on my mind  
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes  
I ain't even think of letting go

You don't need a lot of money  
Honey, you don't have to play no games  
All I need is all your loving  
To get the blood rushing through my veins  
Huh  
I wanna say we're going steady  
Ha  
Like it's 1954,  
No,  
It doesn't have to be forever  
Just as long as I'm the name  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
You don't need to worry about making me crazy  
'Cause I'm way past that  
Eh, and so just call me, if you want me  
'Cause you got me, and I'll show you, how much I wanna be  
On your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as I'm  
The name on your tattooed heart  
  
Wrap me in your jacket  
My baby  
And lay me in your bed  
And kiss me, underneath the moonlight  
Darling let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart  
  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
Tattooed heart  
  
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart


[Verse 1]  
I've been thinking 'bout you  
Yeah, I been missing you  
Where the hell are you, oh, when I need you?  
I could still hear your voice  
I ain't got no choice, cause I'm here all alone  
I know I can't wait 'til you get home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I don't have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I can't control my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Got these thoughts in my head  
Ain't no way to forget  
Got me losing my breath  
Nobody got me the way that you did  
Had my eyes rolling back  
Had me arching my back  
Now you love me so good  
I wish you would hurry up and come back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I don't have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I can't control my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you, baby  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else  
So hurry, cause I need some, need some, need some help  
And I'll be waiting patient, patiently  
Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you  
I'm just thinkin' bout you  
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you


You know what I want, I know what you don't  
I should be the one you love uh  
Boy you got my mind, playing truth or dare  
Daring me kiss you right here  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see, you're perfect for me  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
  
  
Remember that girl, that you used to date  
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great  
So what would you do? What would you say?  
If I said I loved you [?]  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see, you're perfect for me  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close

Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close

All my ladies  
All my ladies

I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close


[Verse 1]  
How do I make the phone ring?  
Why do I even care?  
How are you all around me when you're not really there?  
When you're not really there?  
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin?  
Why do you say you want me, then tell me "I'm not coming in"?  
Baby, just come on in  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Verse 2]  
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?  
Why don't we face the danger just for the night and forget?  
Baby, let's just forget  
Remind me why we're taking a break  
It's obviously insane  
Cause we both know what we want  
So why don't we fall in love?  
Baby, let's fall in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Refrain]  
Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it  
  
[Bridge]  
Remind me why we're taking a break  
It's obviously insane  
Cause we both know what we want  
So why don't we fall in love?  
Baby, let's be in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Outro]  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna


[Verse 1]  
On the first day of Christmas  
When you gave me all them kisses  
Boy, you showed me things  
Come hold me please, and never let me go  
On the second day of Christmas  
Said you felt like something's missing  
So you promised me  
That promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
On the third day of Christmas  
We got all in our feelings, said I love you and meant it, oh  
On the fourth we committed  
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)  
You are my true love  
  
[Verse 2]  
On the fifth day of Christmas  
You asked me what's on my wishlist  
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo  
After six days in your arms  
I got that tattoo on my heart  
Cause I'm your moonlight  
You're my star and nothing's shining more than you boy  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
You completed the vision  
Now I feel like I'm living, you're so one in a million, oh  
I'm so glad we committed  
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love  
You are my true love  
You are my true love  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)  
You are my true love


Verse:  
I'm gonna mix a potion up  
Make a special drink for you  
Mmmm hmmm  
Just a little sip and you're never gonna know what hit you  
Yeh  
When I'm through  
Aww yeh  
  
Pre:  
Now I'm not talkin' bout movies  
Don't need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And stay through thick and thin  
I'm just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little drunk  
And if you try to leave me  
I'll lock you in the trunk  
  
Chorus:  
I'm gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you  
My voodoo's so addicting  
3 silver spoons of brandy wine  
Just a frog and a little thyme and  
Baby you'll be mine  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
  
Verse 2:  
Boy I really knew you were the one  
The moment that I saw your eyes  
Mmm hmmm  
Strong and wise and sweet and quiet  
Yeah you're just my type  
Mmm hmmm  
  
Pre 2:  
Now I'm not talkin' bout movies  
Don't need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And be my shiny prince  
I'm just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little high  
But we'll be so enchanted  
And you'll feel so alive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bridge:  
I always get  
Just what I want  
And boy I really want you now  
So just say yes  
Can't second guess the power of my voodoo love  
  
[Chorus: X2]


[Verse 1]  
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from  
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun  
My jacket don't get no love, no hats and no gloves, not even a chance to rain  
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey  
  
[Verse 2]  
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown (No, no, no, downtown)  
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out  
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build, most of our friends at the
beach  
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey  
  
[Bridge]  
Just imagine that we're laughing  
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside  
Even though this sun is blasting  
We can be wherever if we visualize  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey


[Verse 1]  
Come and kiss me, baby  
We don't need no mistletoe  
We don't need no fireplace  
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?  
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy  
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play  
'Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas?  
  
[Verse 2]  
We don't need no presents, we don't need the kitchen  
We don't need them recipes  
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread  
I'm made with love  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?  
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy  
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play  
'Tis the season for some love giving  
So I think you should give your love to me  
Baby, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas? (Baby, let me know)  
Are you with it? Are you with it?  
Are you with it this Christmas?


Center of attention once again  
They don't understand  
They don't understand  
Then they try to tell me who I am  
But they don't understand  
They don't understand  
  
If you want a perfect picture to believe in  
Then you can't be looking for me then  
  
I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me  
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me  
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it  
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been  
It's my life so truth be told  
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing clear  
And you think you know but you don't have no idea  
Think you know me but there's more to see my love)  
  
The same arguments time and time again  
And you watched them all happen  
But they don't understand  
Thinkin' you're the reason that it ends  
And he won't be back again  
But they don't understand, no  
  
If you want a perfect picture to believe in  
Then you can't be looking for me then  
  
I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me  
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me  
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it  
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been  
It's my life so truth be told  
You don't know me  
  
The girl you see in photographs is only  
A part of the one I am, don't judge me  
Cause that's not reality and all I can be  
Is in love with who I'm becoming  
  
(Think you know me but there's more to see my love  
And you think you know but you don't have no idea)  
  
I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me  
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me  
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it  
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been  
It's my life so truth be told  
You don't know me  
  
I don't need to live by your rules, you don't control me  
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes, you don't know me  
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it  
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been  
It's my life so truth be told  
(I see you thinking but there's just one thing clear  
And you think you know but you don't have no idea  
Think you know me but there's more to see my love)


[Verse 1]  
Now you're finally tell me how you feel  
This to us just came a little too late  
All the drama, boy, it's over kill  
Don't be mad at me cause you've been replaced, know your place  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you would have manned up  
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt  
Then maybe it'd be different  
If it was me that would have listened  
But now I'm with somebody else  
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up  
But it sucks to be all in your head  
Wondering where this thing could go  
  
But, you will never know  
  
[Chorus]  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back thenboy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was probably hard for you to hear  
But there's nothing left for you to say  
Had my heart all in your hands  
Boy what you don't understand  
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you would have manned up  
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt  
Then maybe it'd be different  
If it was me that would have listened  
But now I'm with somebody else  
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up  
But it sucks to be all in your head  
Wondering where this thing could go  
But, you will never know  
  
[Chorus]  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back then  
Boy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Hook]  
You'll never know  
Boy you should have told me, told me  
You'll never know  
Boy you should have let me knowyou'll never know  
Boy you could have been there for me  
But now you'l never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Bridge]  
It's not my fault  
You're a little bit too late  
You're the only one to blame  
Wipe that look off your face  
You can wish a thousand times  
But none of that will change my mind, boy  
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, nothing  
  
[Chorus]  
You will never know  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back then  
Boy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know


Ariana! Iyaz!  
  
Last night was crazy, and today it's settin' in  
Did you really mean it and could you say it again? Oh, oh  
Even if you just say it over the phone (come on and make it real)  
  
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb, and paranoid  
But I'll take a chance on us and hope you don't destroy my heart  
Just give me one guarantee, I'm the only girl you see  
Whatchu say, boy?

I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
Every day and night, you got an open invitation  
As long as I'm your one and only destination  
Fly with me, I'll be your fantasy  
  
You're in demand, but baby, baby so am I  
But if you're weak and try to sneak, I'll have to tell you bye-bye.  
Imma put you on the spot, am I your only girl or not?  
What ya say, boy?  
  
You're my only shawty  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only)  
I'm tellin' you the truth  
Girl, it's only you  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only)  
You're my only one and only  
  
You're my only shawty (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only shawty?)  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
See yeah back in the day I was trapped in a daze  
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (Same old)  
When I see you passing, the passionate flames  
Simple interaction is all that I crave  
I don't need to bring in all the attention  
Girl, I need you, your love and affection.  
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?  
  
You're my only shawty (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (baby, come clean! )  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only one and only  
  
You're my only shawty(am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only shawty, yee yee yee (am I your only shawty?)  
I'm tellin' you the truth (oh oh)  
Girl, it's only you (oh oh)  
You're my only, you're my only (am I your only shawty?)  
You're my only, you're my only shawty  
  
Am I your only?  
Am I your only?  
Tell me, am I your only shawty? (yes, you are.)  
Why won't you say that (yes, you are.)  
Am I your only shawty?
