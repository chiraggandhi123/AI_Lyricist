I'm sleeping my way out of this one  
With anyone who will lie down  
I'll be stuck fixated on one star  
When the world is crashing down  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
But you've got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well on my own  
  
The only thing worse that not knowing  
Is you think that I don't know  
I'm having another episode  
I just need a stronger dose  
  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
But you've got me looking in through blinds  
I keep telling myself  
I keep telling myself  
I'm not the desperate type  
  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well  
Sitting out dances on the wall  
Trying to forget everything that isn't you  
I'm not going home alone  
Cause I don't do too well on my own

Clap until your hands hurt,  
Standing ovations or boo-boo-boos  
Wa-wa-watch us until we blur,  
Walk off into the sunset  
Tell Rock'n'Roll I'm alone again  
I wanna put the midwest home again  
Your time has passed  
They say never means never  
So the fast dance won't last,  
But never means forever  
Never means forever  
  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
Eh, eh, eh-eh, eh, eh  
ALPHAdog and oh oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo  
Welcome to the new deja vu  
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains  
ALPHAdog and oh, oh OMEGAlomaniac  
  
We must have the best coach  
Tell the best jokes  
We must make it hard to  
Look so easy doing something so hard  
Like you must see my way  
They scream when they look at me  
I'm a, I'm a star  
I'm a, I'm a star  
I'm a star, Ohh, I'm a star

Welcome to the new deja vu  
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains  
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac  
  
You're not the first  
Or the last but you're possibly the prettiest  
Whoa  
  
He's a fighter past his prime  
He's in the gutter waving his hand  
I'm just fine  
  
You're not the first  
Or the last but you're possibly the prettiest

How cruel is the golden rule  
When the lives we lived are only golden plated?  
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me  
And though I carry karats for everyone to see  
  
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies  
And all the lovers with no time for me  
And all of the mothers raise their babies  
To stay away from me  
  
Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams  
Where the sewage of youth drowned the spark of my teens  
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me  
And though I carry karats for everyone to see  
  
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies  
And all the lovers with no time for me  
And all of the mothers raise their babies  
To stay away from me  
And pray they don't grow up to be


My heart ticks in beat with  
These kids that I grew up with  
Living like life's going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
Where we came from and where we call home  
  
Hey Chris, you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated, we love you back  
  
They'll say it's not worth  
So we'll leave this town in ruins  
Living like life's going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
These busted lips we take back home  
  
Hey Chris, you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated, we love you back  
  
I know you would be there either way  
I'm so glad it seems like these time will never fade


Landing on a runway in Chicago and I'm grounding all my dreams of ever really
seeing California, because I know what's in between is something sensual in
such non-conventional ways.  
  
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say.  
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away.  
Tonight is all about "We miss you."  
  
And I can't forget your style or your cynicism,  
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen to everything we said.  
My smile's an open wound without you...and my hands are tied to pages inked to
bring you back.  
  
These friends are, new friends are golden.


It's all a game of this or that  
Now verses then  
Better off against  
Worse for wear  
And you're someone  
Who knows someone who knows someone I once knew  
And I just want to be a part of this  
  
The road outside my house  
Is paved with good intentions  
Hired a construction crew  
'Cause it's hell on the engine  
And you are the dreamer  
And we are the dream  
I could write it better than you ever felt it  
  
[Chorus:]  
So hum hallelujah  
Just off the key of reason  
I thought I loved you  
But it's just how you looked in the light  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues and swallow them too  
  
My words are my faith  
To hell with our good name  
A remix up your guts  
Your insides x-rayed  
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster  
We're a bull  
Your ears are just a china shop  
  
I love you in the same way  
There's a chapel in a hospital  
One foot in your bedroom  
And one foot out the door  
Sometimes we take chances  
Sometimes we take pills  
I could write it better than you ever felt it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu... (hum hallelujah)  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu... (hum hallelujah)  
  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues  
And swallow them too  
  
So, hum hallelujah  
Just off the key of reason  
I thought I loved you  
It's just how you looked in the light  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
A teenage love in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
A teenage vow in a parking lot  
Till tonight do us part  
I sing the blues and swallow them too


Brothers and sisters put this record down  
Take my advice ('cause we are bad news)  
We will leave you high and dry  
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose  
  
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless  
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."  
  
We're only liars, but we're the best (we're the best)  
We're only good for the latest trends  
We're only good cause you can have almost famous friends  
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense  
  
Brothers and sisters, yeah, put these words down  
Into your notebook (spit lines like these)  
We're friends when you're on your knees  
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet  
  
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless  
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."  
  
We're only liars, but we're the best (we're the best)  
We're only good for the latest trends  
We're only good cause you can have almost famous friends  
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense  
  
We're only liars, but we're the best

Besides, we've got such good fashion sense


Walking off that stage tonight  
I know what you're thinking  
And he stands alone, because he's high on himself  
But if you only knew  
I was terrified and would you mind if I sat next to you  
And watched you smile  
So many kids but I only see you  
And I don't think you notice me  
Well I've seen your boyfriend and I don't think he treats you right,  
But that's none of my business is it?  
I'm not the way you think I am  
The only girl who ever gave me the time  
Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine  
Knocking boots in the back, how degrading is that?  
I decline.


I am such a sucker  
And I'm always the last to know  
My insides are copper  
And I'd kill to make them gold  
  
Conversation got me here: another night alone in the city  
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true  
  
When you go, I will forget everything about you  
  
I've seen sinking ships go down with more grace than you  
Turn this up I'll tune you out  
Another night alone in the city  
Thinking that you matter  
That's a lie we can both keep  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true  
  
When you go, I will forget everything about you  
  
Every friend we ever had in common  
I will sever the tie with you  
You can thank your lucky stars  
That everything I wish for will never come true


I speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself  
So listen carefully to every word I say:  
"I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today,  
  
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have"  
Blackmailed myself  
Cause I ain't got anyone else  
"This is a stick up  
Give us all your inspiration"  
I've got the red carpet blues baby  
  
"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound  
But don't get the wrong idea  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you  
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet  
That could change just how this goes  
No  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you"  
  
When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse  
Now again I think "His and her's" "For better or worse"  
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes  
  
"You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have"  
I've got the red carpet blues baby  
  
"Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound  
But don't get the wrong idea  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you  
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet  
That could change just how this goes"  
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat


When Rome's in ruins,  
We are the lions free of the coliseums  
In poison places, we are empty venom  
We're the beginning of the end  
  
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds  
It's all over now  
Before it has begun  
We've already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?  
  
Come on, make it easy, say I never mattered  
Run it up the flag pole,  
We will teach you how to make boys next door out of assholes  
  
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds  
And it's all over now  
Before it has begun  
We've already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana, exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?


The D.A. is dressed to the nines  
In the mirror he practices all his lines  
To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor  
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper  
The headline reads: "The man hangs, but the jury doesn't."  
  
And everybody's looking for relief  
The United States versus disbelief  
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle  
From face to floor the body falls like bachelors or bad luck girls  
Only breathing with the aid of the knife  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can't lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
He glances at his pew seating seven to twelve stacked  
On one to six the gallery is hushed  
Boys in three pieces dream of girls' daring and bravado  
The city streets in a cell not withstanding what we don't know  
Hang on the rope of bated breath  
Whichever you prefer  
  
And everyone's looking for relief  
A bidding war for an old friend's grief  
The calls for chick, the calls for charm  
Another girl that's not aware but that can make you comprehend  
Too well dressed for the witness stand  
The best place for whichever headlines run  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
First class suit and tie  
I'm desperate  
Sing and die  
Can talk my way out of anything  
The foreman reads the verdict and the above-entitled actions  
We find the defendant (guilty)  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can left his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
Case open, case shut  
That you could be the cause of that casket  
Baby boy can left his head and he cares  
Isn't it tragic?


These are your good years  
Don't take my advice  
You never wanted the nice boys anyway  
And I'm of good cheer  
Cause I've been checking my list  
The gifts you're receiving from me  
Will be  
  
One awkward silence  
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
And all I want this year is for you to dedicate your last breath to me  
Before you bury yourself alive  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Happy new years baby  
You owe me the best gift I will ever ask for  
Don't call me up, when the snow comes down  
It's the only thing I want this year  
  
One awkward silence  
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep  
Staying up, waiting by the phone  
All I want this year is for you to dedicate your last breathe to me  
Before you bury yourself alive  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree (don't come home for Christmas)  
Merry Christmas, I could care less  
  
Don't come home for Christmas  
You're the last thing I want to see  
Underneath the tree (don't come home for Christmas)  
Merry Christmas, I could care less


[Verse 1]  
Have you ever wanted to disappear  
And join a monastery  
Go out and preach on Manic Street?  
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger  
On a passenger plane?  
(Passenger plane)  
  
Oh,  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back (please take be back)  
Please take be back  
Oh, oh  
I'm a stray dog sick  
Please let me in (please let me in)  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
[Verse 2]  
It feels like fourteen karats but no clarity  
When I look at the man who would be king  
The man who would be king goes to the  
Desert to sing war his dad rehearsed  
Came back with flags on coffins and said  
We won, oh, we won  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back (Please take me back)  
Please take me back  
Oh, oh  
I'm a stray dog sick  
Please let me in (Please let me in)  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
[Bridge]  
B-B-B-B-Benzedrine  
My, my, my Benzedrine  
My B-B-B-B-Benzedrine now  
  
Only one book really matters, the rest of the proof  
Is on the television, on the  
  
[Chorus]  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
Have you ever wanted to disappear?  
  
It's not me, it's you  
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me  
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me  
I'm just a racehorse on the track  
Send me back to the glue factory  
Always thought I'd float away  
And never come back  
But I've got enough miles on my card  
To fly the boys home on my own  
But you know me: I like being all alone  
And keeping you all alone  
And the charts are boring  
And the kids are snoring  
And the eagles in a sling  
You say you're not listening  
And I said I'm wishing  
And I said, I said...


If home is where the heart is  
Then we're all just fucked  
I can't remember  
I can't remember  
  
And I want it so bad  
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins  
I can't remember the good old days  
  
And it's kind of funny  
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts  
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse  
  
[Chorus]  
My mind is a safe  
And if I keep it then we all get rich  
My body is an orphanage  
We take everyone in  
Doing lines of dust and sweat  
Off last night's stage  
Just to feel like you  
  
The milligrams in my head  
Burning tobacco in the wind  
Chasing the direction  
Chasing the direction  
Chasing the direction you went  
  
You're a bottled star  
The planets align  
Just like Mars  
You shine in the sky  
You shine in the sky  
  
Are all the good times getting gone?  
They come and go and come and go and come and go  
I've got a lot of friends who are stars  
But some are just black holes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And it's kind of funny  
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts  
When being anchored aboard just feels like a curse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If home is where the heart is  
Then we're all just fucked


I confess, I'm messed up  
Dropping "I'm sorry's" like you're still around  
And I know you dressed up  
Said "hey kid you'll never live this down"  
  
And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with  
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances  
  
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming  
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"  
  
I don't blame you for being you  
But you can't blame me for hating it  
So say, what are you waiting for?  
Kiss her, kiss her  
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late  
  
Write me off, give up on me  
Cause darling what did you expect  
I'm just off a lost cause  
A long shot, don't even take this bet  
  
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights  
Get all the sighs and the moans just right  
  
I'm just always on  
You said you'd keep me honest  
(you're always on)  
But I won't call you on it


I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going,  
But I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
  
Cut me off, I lost my track  
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac  
It's not funny anymore, no it's not  
  
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah  
  
I'm outside the door, let me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet  
  
'Cause I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
  
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah  
  
I'm outside the door, invite me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet  
  
Yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end


[Pre-Chorus]  
When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass  
Now I know they'll never last  
And I just want my childhood back  
I just want my childhood dead  
I just wanna take it back  
  
[Chorus][X2]  
Cargo and despair  
All american made  
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame  
  
Huh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass  
Now I know they'll never last  
And I just want my childhood back  
I just want my childhood dead  
I just wanna take it back  
  
[Chorus]  
Cargo and despair  
All american made  
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame  
  
[Outro]  
Whoo! Fuckin' flames


You could have knocked me out with a  
(Feather)  
I know you've heard this all before, but were just Hell's  
(Neighbors)  
Why-why-why won't the world revolve around me?  
Build my dreams  
Trees grow all over the streets  
  
But I don't know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke  
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike,  
Media blitz  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts  
But I must confess  
I'm in love with my own sins  
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts  
But I must confess  
I'm in love with my own sins  
  
You can bow and pretend  
That you don't, don't know you're a legend oh  
Time, time, time, hasn't told  
Anyone else, yeah  
Let my love loose again  
  
But I don't know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck classic coke  
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike  
Media blitz  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could have knocked me out with a feather  
I know you heard this all before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suitehearts, suitehearts, suitehearts (suitehearts)


We're pretty boys  
For secret girls  
Who never stood a ch-ch-ch-ch-chance in the world  
I'm not ready for sincerity  
I'd tell any lie to keep you listen-listen-listen-listening  
  
I gave you pretentious.  
I gave you indifference, but you only wanted undressed and defenseless.  
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents  
Who are you kidding? (Who are you kidding?)  
So listen-listen-listen  
  
Sincerity's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year no one will even care.  
  
If it's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year  
  
Everyone loves an underdog  
That's why you're singing along.  
  
With all your cheap words  
Who are you kidding?  
  
We're pretty boys  
For secret girls  
Who are you kidding?  
  
Sincerity's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year no one will even care.  
  
If it's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year  
  
(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog)  
(Hey! Everyone loves an underdog)  
  
When the hook sets in  
And this all ends.  
I'll wish it never began,  
Oh I will die without the attention.  
  
When the hook sets in  
And when this all ends.  
I will wish it never began,  
Oh I will die without the attention.  
Oh I will die without the attention.  
  
Sincerity's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year no one will even care.  
  
If it's in  
So don't you sound like you mean it  
Hold back your breath  
In a year


I wrote a goodbye note  
In lipstick on your arm  
When you passed out  
I couldn't bring myself to call  
Except to call it quits  
  
[Chorus]  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellow-checkered cars  
  
This city says  
Come hell or high water  
When I'm feeling hot and wet  
I can't commit to a thing  
Be it heart or hospital  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The tombstones are waiting  
They were half engraved  
They knew it was over  
Just didn't know the date  
  
And I cast a spell over the West  
To make you think of me  
The same way I think of you  
This is a love song in my own way  
Happily ever after below the waist  
  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellow-checkered cars  
  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers


They told him don't you ever come around here  
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear  
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear  
So beat it, just beat it  
  
You better run, you better do what you can  
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man  
You wanna be tough, better do what you can  
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

They're out to get you, better leave while you can  
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man  
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can  
So beat it, just beat it  
  
You have to show them that you're really not scared  
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare  
They'll kick you, then they beat you,  
Then they'll tell you it's fair  
So beat it, but you wanna be bad  
  
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it  
No one wants to be defeated  
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight  
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Riff  
  
1 2!  
  
I Just Want to feel you up with such dread  
Let you suck it out let you suck it out  
Till I'm dry and dead  
Now I've got love flowin in my nightmare girls  
Caffeine Cold Caffeine Cold and I can't see shit  
  
Don't breathe life in to the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
Now I smell like cigarettes  
Cause I love to breathe your smoke  
I smell like alcohol  
Cause I drink to believe in more  
  
I have 3 drinks  
Before I even start to count  
I think I'm gonna move  
Way down south  
  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
Don't breathe life into the monster then  
Complain when he destroys it all again  
  
"I'm not a monster  
Just really fucked up  
I'm tired  
I'll see you in hell  
Are you judging me?  
Don't laugh at me  
Don't laugh at me  
No seriously don't laugh at me  
It's not funny  
I'm not joking  
It's not funny  
I'm not laughing"


Sat outside my front window  
This story's going somewhere  
He's well hung and I am hanging on  
There's a song on the radio that says  
"Let's get this party started"  
So let's get this party started  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know  
And what meant the world had folded  
Like legs and fingers holding on to  
What escapes me what he has:  
A better kiss that never lasts  
  
[Chorus]  
You said between your smiles and regrets  
"Don't say it's over"  
Dead and gone  
Dead and gone yeah  
  
The calm before the storm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
A reception less than warm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
  
This is me standing in the arch of the door  
Hating that look that's on your face  
That says there's another fool like me  
There's one born every minute  
There's one born every minute  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know (never want to know)  
What meant the world imploded  
Inflated then demoted all my  
Oxygen to product gas  
And suffocated my last chance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)  
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)  
  
The calm before the storm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
A reception less than warm set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
  
Sun burnt out tonight  
The sun burnt out tonight


White sands swollen glands  
Paris Tokyo New New New York M-M-M-Mexico  
Stay plastic woo ooh  
Stay tragic woo ooh  
Proclamation of emancipation  
Oh dear lord, let me into heaven for just an afternoon.  
  
Oh Sam I a,  
I can't go to sleep without Ambien  
Seem so happy call me mister goodbye  
Say catch me if you can, catch me if you can  
  
Let's talk about the scene for a minute  
I know we ain't been seen in a minute  
We left before a minute now we all love in it  
Baby boy if you got the big dreams gonna get it  
Never been the type in tight jeans I won't fit in  
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in  
And I'm living clean now while you all walk in it  
Notice me but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it


[Intro]  
Du du du du-du du du du  
Du du du du du-du du du  
  
[Chorus]  
Some legends are told,  
Some turn to dust or to gold,  
But you will remember me,  
Remember me for centuries.  
And just one mistake,  
Is all it will take.  
We'll go down in history,  
Remember me for centuries.  
Heyyyyy yeah, oh heyyyyy, heyyyyy yeah,  
Remember me for centuries.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Mummified my teenage dreams,  
No, it's nothing wrong with me.  
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off,  
Heavy metal broke my heart.  
Come on, come on, and let me in,  
The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints.  
And this is supposed to match,  
The darkness that you felt.  
I never meant for you to fix yourself!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Du du du du-du du du du  
Du du du du-du du du du  
  
[Chorus]  
Some legends are told,  
Some turn to dust or to gold,  
But you will remember me,  
Remember me for centuries!  
And just one mistake,  
Is all it will take,  
We'll go down in history,  
Remember me for centuries!  
Heyyyyy yeah, oh heyyyyy, heyyyyy yeah,  
Remember me for centuries!  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I can't stop until the whole world knows my name,  
Cause I was only born inside my dreams,  
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you,  
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia.  
And you're a cherry blossom,  
You're about to bloom,  
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Du du du du-du du du du  
Du du du du-du du du du  
  
[Chorus]  
Some legends are told,  
Some turn to dust or to gold,  
But you will remember me,  
Remember me for centuries!  
And just one mistake,  
Is all it will take,  
We'll go down in history,  
Remember me for centuries!  
Heyyyyy yeah, oh heyyyyy, heyyyyy yeah,  
Remember me for centuries!  
  
[Bridge]  
We've been here forever,  
And here's the frozen proof.  
I could scream forever,  
We are the poisoned youth!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Du du du du-du du du du  
Du du du du-du du du du  
  
[Chorus]  
Some legends are told,  
Some turn to dust or to gold,  
But you will remember me,  
Remember me for centuries!  
And just one mistake,  
Is all it will take,  
We'll go down in history,  
Remember me for centuries!  
Heyyyyy yeah, oh heyyyyy, heyyyyy yeah,  
Remember me for centuries!  
  
[Outro]  
We'll go down in history,  
Remember me for centuries!


You are a getaway car, a rush of blood to the head  
But me, I'm just the covers on top of your bed  
You steer away in a rear view mirror you make my head swim  
I keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been  
  
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin  
When it's said and down they're all scrambling  
And we're friends, yeah we're friends  
Just because we move units  
  
Strike us like matches, cause everyone deserves the flames  
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame  
At least everyone is trying, everyone else is shining  
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame  
Such a shame  
  
The sounds of this small town make my ears hurt  
Oh yeah, you caught me. But I caught you way worse  
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war."  
But who are you fighting for?  
The tides out, the ship's run aground  
We drown traitors in shallow water


My heart is on my sleeve  
Wear it like a bruise or black eye  
My badge, my witness  
That means I believed  
Every single lie you said  
  
Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap  
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you  
And every little tap on the shoulder for attention  
Fails to mention I still hate you  
  
But there's a light on in Chicago  
And I know I should be home  
All the colors of the street signs  
They remind me of the pickup truck  
Out in front of your neighbor's house  
  
She took me down and said  
"Boys like you are overrated. So save your breath"  
Loaded words and loaded friends  
Are loaded guns to our heads.  
Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap  
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you  
And every little tap on the shoulder for attention  
Fails to mention I still hate you  
  
But there's a light on in Chicago  
And I know I should be home  
All the colors of the street signs  
They remind me of the pickup truck  
Out in front of your neighbor's house  
  
You want apologies, girl you might hold your breath  
Until your breathing stops forever  
The only thing you'll get  
Is this curse on your lips  
I hope they taste of me forever  
  
But there's a light on in Chicago  
And I know I should be home  
All the colors of the street signs  
They remind me of the pickup truck  
Out in front of your neighbor's...  
  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
(There's a light on)  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again  
  
(There's a light on)  
With every breath I wish your body  
Will be broken again


I can't explain a thing  
I want everything  
To change and stay the same on top  
Doesn't care about anyone or anything  
Now come together, come apart  
Only get lonely when you read the charts  
  
Oh baby, when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
Then I got cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em like you just don't care  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh change will come  
Oh change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
We never believe again  
Kick drum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
  
Oh, I'm a mascot for what you've become  
And oh, oh, I love the mayhem more than the love  
And oh baby, when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
When I got cold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care  
Oh, throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh, change will come  
Oh, change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand


She says she's no good with words but I'm worse  
Barely stuttered out  
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue  
And weighed down with words too overdramatic  
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"  
Vs. "no one should ever feel like.."  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
  
You always fold just before you're found out  
Drink up its last call  
Last resort  
But only the first mistake and I  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (love)  
  
Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (with love)  
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me  
  
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me


I hope this is the last time  
Cause I'd never say no to you  
This conversation's been dead on arrival  
There's no way to talk to you  
This conversation's been dead on  
  
A rivalry goes so deep  
Between me and this loss of sleep over you  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know I'm not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like  
Never stick at first  
So I'm writing you a chorus  
And here is your verse  
  
No it's not the last time  
Cause I never say no to you  
This conversation's still dead on arrival  
There's no way to talk to you  
When you're dead on  
  
A rivalry goes so deep  
Between me and this loss of sleep over you  
  
This is side one (This is my side one)  
Flip me over  
I know I'm not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like (songs you grow to like)  
Never stick at first  
So I'm writing you a chorus  
And here is your  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know I'm not your favorite record  
So  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
  
This is side one  
Flip me over  
I know I'm not your favorite record  
The songs you grow to like  
Never stick at first  
So I'm writing you a chorus  
And here is your verse  
Here is your


I'm coming apart at the seams.  
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams.  
Like buzz, buzz, buzz.  
Doc, there's a hole where something was.  
Doc, there's a hole where something was.  
  
Fell out of bed.  
Butterfly bandage,  
But don't worry.  
You'll never remember,  
Your head is far too blurry.  
Put him in the back of a squad car  
Restrain that man  
He needs his head put through a cat scan.  
Hey editor, I'm undeniable  
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable  
Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match,  
I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet  
  
[Chorus]  
So boycott love  
Detox just to retox  
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life  
And perfect boys  
With their perfect lives  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
  
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)  
  
Oh,  
  
Little girl  
You got my staring odd, oh  
Or was it just a telescopic camera nod  
Painted doors in the highway  
Truck stop stalls  
Lot-lizards scales to deny my rules  
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk, when you leave the
room  
  
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine  
What a match,  
I am half doomed and you're semi-sweet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)  
  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
Detox just to retox  
So boycott love  
Boycott love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Wants to hear you sing)  
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy  
Whoa

I can't do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
I can't do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
  
When you're watching this  
I'll be in the desert just wishing on every star  
Scuba diving in the wishing well  
Just trying to save myself  
Hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
But I'll save the middle finger for you  
You get scared when you look at me  
Cause I, I'm so fine  
Miss me? Me love, Mr. Superstar  
Hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
But I'll save the middle finger for you  
  
I can't do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer  
I can't do this again  
I need more oxygen  
Our days were never numbered  
This is eternal summer


This might just be a waste of time,  
But there's no one I'd rather,  
Waste my time with than all my best friends,  
To stop this horror.  
  
We'll all take turns not for the worst.  
We're all has-beens and never-weres.  
We're all in the back singing "Roxanne"  
Just watching life pass us by. (Pass us by)  
  
As if we had enough to try to kiss her.  
Enough to make up for lost time.  
Enough to make up for lost time.  
  
We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging round.  
Take your passes to no direction, yeah.  
Stop moving, get me out of this one horse town.  
Waste this night.  
  
Whoo!  
We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging round.  
Take your passess to no direction, yeah.  
Stop moving, get me out of this one horse town.  
Waste this night, waste this night.


I'm trying not to wonder what you're doing now and it still hurts somehow  
Our pictures disappeared with communications down and I'm living out of town  
But the formula for love was found to be untrue - I wait for you  
To call me up someday and tell me that you're wrong-it's been too long  
And the formula for love was found to be untrue - I wait for you  
Don't try to tell me that my love for you was wrong  
And don't try to tell me that you knew it all along  
You never loved, you don't know how  
And I feel bad for you right now  
  
I'm trying not to wonder whose heart you'll break this time-  
You can bet it won't be mine.


'I just want to be better than your head's only medicine'  
A downward spiral just a pirouette  
Getting worse til there's nothing left  
What good comes of something when I'm just the ghost of nothing?  
'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':  
"Nobody will ever remember me,"  
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees  
(for a)  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?  
Oh, their faces are dancing  
They're dancing til  
Til they can't stand it  
A composer but never composed  
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed  
A composer but never composed  
'Singing':  
"I only want what I can't have"  
'Heralded as a king before I had a birthday  
With double digits  
Fit the crown to my head but I was only a kid'  
'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':  
"Nobody will ever remember me,"  
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees  
(for a)  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?  
Oh, their faces are dancing  
They're dancing til  
Til they can't stand it  
A composer but never composed  
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed  
A composer but never composed  
'Singing':  
"I only want what I can't have"  
'I just want to be better than your head's only medicine'  
'I'm just the man on the balcony singing':  
"Nobody will ever remember me,"  
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees  
(for a)  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic?  
Oh, their faces are dancing  
They're dancing til  
Til they can't stand it

A composer but never composed  
'Singing'  
"I only want what I can't have"


I've loved everything about you that hurts, so  
Let me see your moves,  
Let me see your moves  
Lips pressed this close to mine,  
True Blue  
  
But the prince of any failing empire knows that  
Everybody wants, everybody wants  
To drive on through the night  
If it's a drive back home  
  
Things aren't the same anymore  
Some nights, they get so bad  
You almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying,  
I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
I've already given up on myself twice  
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm  
Threw caution to the wind  
But I've got a lousy arm  
  
And I've traced your shadows on the wall  
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down  
Whenever I'm down  
Figured on not figuring myself out  
  
Things aren't the same anymore  
Some nights, they get so bad  
I almost pick up the phone  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying  
That I know I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
Born under a bad sign, but you saved my life  
That night on the roof of your hotel  
"Cross my heart and hope to die  
Splintered from the headboard in my eye"  
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well  
  
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns  
I sleep with your old shirts  
And walk through this house in your shoes,  
You know it's strange  
It's a strange way of saying  
That I know I'm supposed to love you  
I'm supposed to love you  
  
Now press repeat


Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
When I wake up,  
I'm willing to take my chances on  
The hope I forget  
That you hate him more than you notice  
I wrote this for you (for you, so)  
  
You need him  
I could be him  
I could be an accident but I'm still trying  
That's more than I can say for him  
  
Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
Someday I'll appreciate in value  
Get off my ass and call you  
But in the meantime I'll sport my brand new fashion  
Of waking up with pants off at 4: 00 in the afternoon  
  
You need him  
I could be him  
I could be an accident but I'm still trying  
That's more than I can say for him  
  
1-2-3-4!  
  
Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
(Won't find out)  
He won't find out  
(Won't find out)  
He won't find out  
  
Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman (he won't find out)  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town


I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep  
I'll crust them over  
She begged me "don't hate me"  
She spun me a story  
Where winning looks like losing  
And I win every time  
So thread spools sweetie, get ready  
Until my silk is sold  
  
Growing up [Repeat: x2  
Yeah, I'll myself a new [Repeat: x1]  
  
I've dried my eyes, now its "Rushmore"  
I'm deep with futures like Chicago  
Glenview never meant a thing to me  
She never meant a thing to me  
Except for putting idealists in a body bag  
Forget it  
I'll go out tonight to piss on her doorstep  
And listen to the misfits "where eagles dare" to swallow whole  
  
Up  
Growing up [Repeat: x1]  
  
Go  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, I guess I'm my own better half [Repeat: x1]  
Whoa, oh,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah, yeah,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I guess I'm on my own


Been gone more days this year than I have been home  
Trading friends for trips to the coast  
This hotel room feels more ohh oh like a tomb

It's not gossip if it's the truth  
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to  
  
So which is it: the boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?  
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing fiction?  
  
Hand over my heart, gun to my head  
I swear to God I'm through with this  
I am the worst liar I know  
  
It's not gossip if it's the truth

Mr. Sandman showing his beam  
When he walks into the room  
The walls lean in to listen  
Surf out brain waves  
Click back and forth like old headlights  
Sniffing model glue again  
  
Head like a steel trap  
Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't,  
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I don't  
Just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness.  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
Does he know the way to worship I know  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?  
  
I will never end up like him  
Behind my back, I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way  
You will always know.  
  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling  
  
Tempest in a teacup,  
Get unique.  
Peroxide Princess shine like shark teeth  
It's a sign, (it's a sign)  
It's a sign, (it's a sign)  
It's a sign, what if you peaked early.  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
Does he know the way, does he know the way  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?  
  
Does he, does he know the way to worship our love?  
Does your husband know the way  
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?  
  
But, I will never end up like him.  
Behind my back, I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know.  
  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
The last time you came through,  
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling  
  
Does your husband know?  
Does your husband know?  
Does your husband know?  
  
Does he know?  
Does he know?  
Does he know?  
  
But, I will never end up like him.  
Behind my back I already am.  
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know.  
  
Oh, the last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.  
Oh, the last time you came through,  
Oh darling, I know what you're going through.


I served out my detention  
And in the end I got an honorable mention  
In the movie of my life, starring you  
Instead of me  
When the moonlight, hits your bright eyes I go blind  
And maybe next time  
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid  
Like I'll never leave your side  
Like the oldest movie I ever saw was the one we wrote together  
I said I hate you but I'd never change a thing  
I can be your John Cusack  
I burnt out  
My defensive  
Now everything I say is taken as offensive


Say my name, and his in the same breath,  
I dare you to say they taste the same,  
Let the leaves fall off in the summer  
And let December glow in flames  
  
Erase myself and let go,  
Start it over again in Mexico  
These friends, they don't love you  
They just love the hotel suites, now  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care what you think,  
As long as it's about me  
The best of us can find happiness, in misery  
I don't care what you think,  
As long as it's about me  
The best of us can find happiness, in misery  
  
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance,  
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants  
Pull a breath like another cigarette,  
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no  
  
I'm the oracle in my chest,  
Let the guitar scream like a fascist,  
Sweat it out, shut your mouth,  
Free love on the streets, but  
In the alley it ain't that cheap now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said-a, I don't care just a-what you think,  
As long as it's about me, you said-a  
I don't care just what you think,  
As long as it's about me, you said-a  
I don't care (I don't care)  
You said I don't care (I don't care)  
Said I don't care, I don't care  
I don't care (I don't care), I said-a, I don't care  
  
[Chorus]


I found the cure to growing older  
And you're the only place that feels like home  
Just so you know, you'll never know  
And some secrets weren't meant to be told  
I found the cure to growing older  
  
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends  
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again  
And I've got arrogance down to a science  
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
Douse yourself in cheap perfume it's  
So fitting, so fitting of the way you are  
You can't cover it up  
Can't cover it up  
  
Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lip  
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped  
Back to your family cause I know you will be missed  
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself  
  
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone  
But for what we've become, we just feel more alone  
Always weigh what I've got against what I left  
So progress report: I am missing you to death  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Always borrowed  
Always you  
  
I found a cure to growing older  
I found a cure to growing older  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Oh,  
Well imagine,  
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor,  
And I can't help but to hear,  
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:  
  
"What a beautiful wedding! What a beautiful wedding," says a bridesmaid to the
waiter,  
"And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore."  
  
I chime in with a,  
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
With a sense of poise and rationality.  
I chime in,  
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
With a sense of...  
  
Oh, Well in fact,  
Well I'll look at this way,  
I mean technically our marriage is saved,  
Well this calls for,  
A toast so,  
Pour the champagne.  
  
Oh! Well in fact,  
Well I'll look at it this way,  
I mean technically our marriage is saved,  
Well this calls for a toast,  
So pour the champagne, pour the champagne!  
  
I chime in with a,  
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
With a sense of poise and rationality.

No, it's much better to face these kinds of things

I chime in,  
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things

I chime in,  
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the Goddamn door?!"  
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  
With a sense of  
Poise and Rationality! Again...


[Verse 1]  
They say we are what we are,  
But we don't have to be.  
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way.  
I'll be the watcher of the eternal flame,  
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass).  
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long.  
Live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long.  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
Immor-immortals, immor-immortals.  
(Im-immortals)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith,  
Is when it's tested again and again everyday.  
I'm still comparing your past to my future,  
It might be your wound, but they're my sutures.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass).  
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long.  
Live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long.  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
(Im-immortals)  
  
[Bridge]  
And live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down.  
  
[Outro]  
We could be immortals, immor-immortals  
Just not for long, for long  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
Immor-immortals, immor-immortals.  
(Im-immortals).


Why can you read me like no one else?  
I hide behind these words,  
But I'm coming out.  
I wish I kept them behind my tongue.  
I hide behind these words,  
But I'm coming out.  
  
Put your hand between an aching head  
And an aching wound.  
We'll make them so jealous,  
We'll make them hate us.  
An aching head  
And an aching wound.  
We'll make them so jealous.  
We'll make them so jealous.  
  
Always you made my stomach turn,  
And all the long drives  
With my friends blur.  
And I wish I kept them inside my mind.  
I hide behind these words,  
And think of all the places  
Where you've been lost,  
And found out.  
In between my sheets,  
In between the rights and the wrongs.  
  
Put your hand between an aching head  
And an aching wound.  
We'll make them so jealous,  
We'll make them hate us.  
An aching head  
And an aching wound.  
  
Think of all the places  
Where you've been lost,  
And found out.


You're a canary  
I'm a coal mine  
'Cause sorrow is just all the rage  
Take one for the team  
You all know what I mean  
  
And I'm so sorry  
But not really  
Tell the boys where to find my body  
New York eyes  
Chicago thighs  
Pushed up the window to kiss you off  
  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
  
Do you remember the way I held your hand  
Under the lamp post and ran home this way?  
So many times I can close my eyes  
  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
  
(The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do)  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth...  
The truth...


[Verse 1]  
I got those jet pack blues just like Judy,  
The kind that makes June feel like September,  
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember.  
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind  
Behind these two-way highway lines,  
When the city goes silent,  
The ringing in my ears gets violent.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got those jet pack blues,  
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me,  
Honey, don't you leave.  
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink?  
It never mattered what it was, I think.  
Our hands were just that close,  
The sweetness never lasted, no.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".  
  
[Bridge]  
She's in a long black coat tonight,  
Waiting for me in the downpour outside.  
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears,  
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time.  
  
[Outro]  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
And I remember "Baby, come home",  
Did you ever love her? Do you know?  
Or did you never want to be alone?  
And she was singing, "Baby, come home",  
"Baby, come home".


Sometimes  
When I'm in heaven  
I get forgetful of the earth, woah oh  
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds  
The heat is on  
Fixed up, and the sheet is down  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother, then forget my head  
With the dead-rid coke, unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun  
  
Pour more in my head my  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid  
  
I got the skyline in my veins  
Forget your night times  
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel  
And joke us, joke us  
Till lake shore drive comes back into focus  
I just want to come back to love  
Spark until you hit it  
Keep you warm at night  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother, then forget my head  
With the dead-rid coke, unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun (fun)  
  
Pour more in my head  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid [x4]

I've been really tryin', baby  
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long  
And if you feel like I feel, baby  
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon  
Let's get it on  
Ah, baby, let's get it on  
Let's love, baby  
Let's get it on, sugar  
Let's get it on  
We're all sensitive people  
With so much to give  
Understand me, sugar  
Since we've to be here  
Let's live  
I love you  
There's nothing wrong with me  
Loving you, baby no no  
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong  
If the love is true  
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be  
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me  
I ain't gonna worry  
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby  
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby  
Stop beatin' 'round the bush  
Let's get it on  
Let's get it on  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
C'mon, baby  
Let your love come out  
If you believe in love  
Let's get it on  
Let's get it on, baby  
This minute, oh yeah  
Let's get it on  
Please, let's get it on  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby  
Stop beatin' 'round the bush  
Oh, gonna get it on

If the spirit moves ya  
Let me groove ya good  
Let your come down  
Oh, get it on  
C'mon, baby  
Do you know the meaning?  
I've been sanctified  
Girl, you give me good feeling


When routine bites hard  
And ambitions are low  
And resentment rides high  
But emotions won't grow  
And we're changing our ways  
Taking different roads  
Love, love will tear us apart  
Again, again, again, again  
  
Why is this bedroom so cold  
Turned away on your side?  
Is my timing that flawed  
Our respect run so dry?  
Yet there's still this appeal  
That we've kept through  
Our lives  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Love, love will tear us apart again  
  
You cry out in your sleep  
All my failings exposed  
There's a taste in my mouth  
As desperation takes hold  
Just that something so good  
Just can't function more  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
Love, love will tear us apart again


Honey is for bees, silly bear.  
Besides, there's jelly beans everywhere.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.  
  
It doesn't matter  
How you feel.  
Life is just a ferris wheel.  
It's always up and down,  
Don't make a sound.  
  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
  
It's just the sweet weather  
And the peacock feathers.  
In the morning,  
It will all be better.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.  
  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
When you wake up,  
The world will come around.  
  
Honey is for bees, silly bear.  
Besides, there's jelly beans everywhere.  
It's not what it seems  
In the land of dreams.  
Don't worry your head,  
Just go to sleep.


Last year's wishes are this year's apologies  
Every last time I come home  
I take my last chance  
To burn a bridge or two  
I only keep myself this sick in the head  
'Cause I know how the words get you  
  
We're the new face of failure  
Prettier and younger, but not any better off  
Bullet proof loneliness  
At best, at best  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(1x)  
  
Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep  
Out of the woods but I love  
A tree I used to lay beneath  
Kiss teeth stained red  
From a sour bottle baby girl  
With eyes the size of baby worlds  
  
We're the new face of failure  
Prettier and younger, but not any better off  
Bullet proof loneliness  
At best, at best  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(3x)  
  
The best way to make it through  
With hearts and wrists in tact  
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad  
Ain't bad  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
If I woke up next to you  
If I woke up next to you  
(2x)  
  
Me and you  
Setting in a honeymoon  
(honeymoon)  
If I woke up next to you  
(honeymoon)


Last night I saw a movie  
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house  
Excuse me if I'm rude  
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without
you  
Leaning on my shoulder  
Distracting me from the plot line  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I' can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks  
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people  
Looking glossed just like a summer ago  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
"Call me back" I'm pleading with a cork in my head  
It wouldn't be the first time  
My pillow has been mistaken  
  
Where can I go when I want you around  
But I can't stand to be around you  
"Go home"  
I'll walk myself to you  
I'll walk myself away from here  
  
Can't stand to be around you  
Around you, around you  
Can't stand to be around you  
Can't stand, I can't stand  
To be around you  
Around you


Spent most of last night  
Dragging this lake  
For the corpses of all my past mistakes  
Sell me out the jokes on you  
We are salt and you are the wound  
  
Empty another bottle  
And let me tear you to pieces  
This is me wishing you into the worst situations  
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go  
But you wouldn't know a good thing  
If it came up and slit your throat  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
Oh  
Whoa  
Whoa  
  
Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears  
Rather ones that just don't care  
Cause I know that your in between arms somewhere  
Next to heartbeats  
Where you shouldn't dare sleep  
Now, I'll teach you a lesson  
For Keeping secrets from me  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
And did you hear the news?  
I could dissect you  
And gut you on this stage,  
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined  
But it will get the job done  
And you're, done  
  
Every line is plotted and designed  
To leave you  
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge  
And everyone else  
That it hits, that it gets to  
Is nothing more than collateral damage  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"


Drink down that gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me be  
  
I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
  
And I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying  
  
Drink down your gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me..  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
I'll watch you sulk  
You look so good in blue  
  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
I'll watch you choke  
  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
  
I'll watch you choke  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
  
[Chorus 2x]


[Verse 1]  
This is a black, black ski mask song,  
So put all of your anger on.  
In the truly gruesome do we trust,  
I will always land on you like a sucker punch.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you,  
You, would never sing along.  
Cast them out because this is our culture,  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm just a problem that doesn't want to be solved,  
So could you please hold your applause?  
Take this sideshow and all its freaks,  
And turn it into the silver screen-dream.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare.  
(Na na na na na, na na na na na na)  
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you,  
You, would never sing along.  
Cast them out because this is our culture,  
These new flocks are nothing but vultures.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole.  
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)  
I sing like a photo that's been over exposed.  
(Hijack the hype, hijack the hype)  
  
[Outro]  
Because they took our love and they filled it up,  
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I'm just numb,  
Now I'm just numb!  
Don't' mind me, I'm just a son of a gun,  
Don't stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb,  
Now I'm just stuck!  
I don't feel a thing for you!


You only hold me up like this  
'Cause you don't know who I really am  
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you  
We're making out inside crashed cars  
We're sleeping through all our memories  
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now I only waste my time
dreaming of you)  
  
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness  
All of our moves make up for the silence  
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase  
Like I'll never be the same  
  
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you  
I'm not trying  
You only hold me up like this


[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls  
  
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]  
That right there should make you wanna fan up  
If you a fan that should make you wanna stand up  
If you already standing, put your hands up  
Real high man, try and touch the banners  
It's the home of the champions  
Hard working turn a home into a mansion  
Need you to put your hands up  
Cause they don't know you gotta make 'em understand us  
From the floor seats to the nosebleeds  
From the young ones to the og's  
From the Bob Loves to the Rozay's  
And from the mj's to the Joakim's  
See the statue outside, how this floor team  
Take a picture, this a city for the winners  
You ain't got horns, you gotta dress warm  
It really get chilly in the city in the winter  
Let's go  
  
[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls  
  
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]  
Fan from Day 1 or from back in the day - 91, 93, 96, 98  
And that white when we at home, that red when away  
Got my jersey, my Jordans, I'm ready to play  
I've been [?] representin' the city I was born in  
From the Go, so you know that we be going in  
Swear to God, I think we about to score again  
And we got that [?], we got that foul and we got that [?]  
They got that style but we got that [?]  
So we shut that down because we got that D fence  
Never let my city down, man I put that on Red Kerr  
Every dunk should make the cover of a magazine  
Feeling flyer than Benny on a trampoline  
  
[Hook: Fall Out Boy]  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls, only the Bulls, only the Bulls  
Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Bulls


You laughed off my affections  
While I passed by your direction  
I should have known from your walk, yeah  
It was the end of you  
  
It's not like I don't respect your opinion  
Quick with lips, just rip me apart  
Sometimes it's times like this, yeah  
  
I got a big mouth  
And maybe you could handle shutting it up  
A simple contradiction  
Could shake my whole foundation  
Parker Lewis can't lose  
  
Taking back every step towards you  
Still failing at everything I do  
In the meantime just talking with my shoes  
Converse with my Converse  
At least they hear a word I say  
And scrutinize it  
Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at  
Tied my tongue around my neck  
For the last time  
  
It's not like I don't respect your opinion  
Quick with lips, just tear me apart  
Sometimes, it's times like this yeah  
  
I got a big mouth  
And maybe you could handle shutting it up  
A simple contradiction  
Could shake my whole foundation  
Parker Lewis can't lose  
  
This is the last song about you


Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Something make my chest stir  
Something make my head blur  
(Oh, oh)  
I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no  
(Oh, oh)  
I'm just such a happy mess, whoa  
  
The drums are four on the floor  
She's back to the bedroom for one more  
I'm the invisible man  
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror  
  
I want to make you as lonely as me  
So you can get, get addicted to this  
You can get, get addicted to this now  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
It's three things too late to talk to anyone but myself  
(Oh, oh)  
It's a three and two pitch to walk to anywhere else, no  
  
The drums are four on the floor  
She's back to the bedroom for one more  
I'm the invisible man  
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror  
  
I want to make you as lonely as me  
So you can get, get addicted to this  
You can get, get addicted to this now  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I'm the invisible man  
Who can't stop staring at the mirror, at the mirror  
  
I want to make you as lonely as me  
So you can get, get addicted to this  
You can get, get addicted to this now  
  
I'm the invisible man  
(I'm the invisible man)  
I'm the invisible man  
(I'm the invisible man)  
I want to make you as lonely as me  
'Cause I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man


It's Courtney, bitch.  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat hey)  
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate  
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation  
So they just DIY'd that shit and built their own bombs  
She's his suicide blond, she's never in gold  
  
Are you ready for another bad poem?  
One more off key anthem  
Let your teeth sink in  
Remember me as I was not as I am  
And I said "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead,"  
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition and she'd let it go to my head  
  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my love is a weapon  
There's no second guessing when I say  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my heart is a grenade  
You pull the pin and say  
  
We're all fighting growing old  
We're all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St. Peter's list  
But you need to lower your standards  
'Cause it's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
We are professional ashes of roses  
This kerosene's live  
You settled your score  
This is where you come to beg, unborn and unshaven  
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens  
This is what we do, we nightmare you  
  
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards  
And your heart beat in reverse  
Our guts can't be reworked  
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert  
Getting burned  
But I'll take your heart served up two ways  
I sing a bitter song  
I'm the lonelier version of you  
I just don't know where it went wrong  
  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my love is a weapon  
There's no second guessing when I say  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my heart is a grenade  
You pull the pin and say  
  
We're all fighting growing old  
We're all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St. Peter's list  
But you need to lower your standards  
'Cause it's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
She's sick and she's wrong  
She's young dirty blonde  
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb  
He says "I've seen bigger"  
She says "I've lit better"  
And they throw the matches down into the glitter  
Not a dry eye left in the house  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
Go boy, go boy, run for your life  
  
We're all fighting growing old  
We're all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St. Peter's list  
But you need to lower your standards  
'Cause it's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
(Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey)  
It's never  
Getting any better than this  
  
Are you ready for another bad poem?


I could walk this fine line between elation and success  
But we all know which way I'm going  
So strike the stake between my chest  
Well "You have to prove yourself"  
You'll have to prove it to me  
  
So now you're waiting up for him  
You're wasting time every time  
  
I can't do it by myself  
  
I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am:  
A failure at everything  
18 going on extinct  
I know my place  
It's nowhere you should roam


I'm good to go and I'm going nowhere fast  
It could be worse, I could be taking you there with me  
I'm good to go, but it looks like I'm still on my own  
  
I'm good to go for something golden  
Though the motions I've been going through have failed  
I'm coasting on potential towards a wall at a hundred miles an hour  
  
When I say  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Pete and I attacked the Lost Astoria  
With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived more than an hour  
  
When I say  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
Me and Pete in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Saturday  
Saturday


[Originally by Jawbreaker]  
  
I have a present,  
It is a present,  
You'll have to learn to find it within you,  
If you could learn,  
To love it you just might like it,  
You can't live without it,  
There's a million open windows,  
Passing these opened windows,  
Passing these opened windows,  
  
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah [x2]  
  
There is plenty,  
To criticize,  
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes,  
But these eyes will stay wide,  
I will stay young,  
Young and dumb inside,  
I had just begun,  
To forget my lines,  
You're not punk and I'm telling everyone  
  
[Chorus:]  
You could save yourself,  
You could save us all,  
Go on living, prove us wrong,  
Your leap of faith,  
Could be a well-timed smile,  
Survival never goes out of style  
  
I have a message: save your generation,  
We're killing each other by sleeping in,  
Finnegan, begin again,  
This one can be won,  
One can become two,  
Two can pick and choose,  
You could be the first  
  
[Chorus:]  
You could save yourself,  
You could save us all,  
Go on living, prove us wrong,  
Your leap of faith,  
Could be a well-timed smile,  
Survival never goes out of style  
  
You have to learn to learn from your mistakes,  
You can afford to lose a little face,  
The things you break,  
Some can't be replaced,  
A simple rule: every day be sure you wake  
  
[Chorus:]  
You could save yourself,  
You could save us all,  
Go on living, prove us wrong,  
Your leap of faith,  
Could be a well-timed smile,  
Survival never goes out of...  
Survival never goes out of...  
Survival never goes out of style


Life's just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
And when the two collide  
It's no coincidence  
The lights are on and everybody's home  
  
The only thing suicidal here is the door  
We had a good run  
Even I have to admit  
Life's just a pay stub on death  
Only less diligent  
  
[Chorus]  
Hell or Glory  
I don't want anything in between  
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes  
Daddy said, "you gotta show the world the thunder!"  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh) the thunder,  
(Oh)  
  
(Oh)  
  
We didn't come to compete  
This is a demonstration  
Even the young ones become irrelevant  
They always bring up how you changed (Oh, oh)  
Never the same person when I go to sleep  
As when I wake up, as when I wake up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Oh, whoa)  
(Oh, whoa)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said "Bring the thunder!"  
  
The thunder  
(Oh) the thunder,  
Whoa


Show me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid  
I, I, I will break his jaw  
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up  
No, oh, oh, oh  
And I will save him from himself  
Here's a picture with a note  
"No, don't turn out like me"  
It's only for your own good  
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And haven't you heard  
The word on the street is  
"I lost it, called it quits"  
Get it into the sun,  
Out from behind the gossip  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, k-keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now-ow-ow - ow  
  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Even when there's  
Nothing worth living for  
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for  
N-no one has to know-ow-ow  
And haven't you heard  
The word on the street is  
"I lost it, called it quits"  
Get it into the sun  
Out from behind the gossip  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old (this story's getting old)  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now,  
  
This story's getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep, keep talking  
Keep this alive  
This story's getting old (this story's getting old)  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind now  
Now, now, now  
  
Stop!

Gotta change my answering machine  
Now that I'm alone  
'Cause right now it says that we  
Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
'Cause you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
It's ridiculous  
It's been months  
And for some reason I just  
Can't get over us  
And I'm stronger then this  
Ain't no faith in her  
Always walkin' 'round  
With my head down  
I'm so over being blue  
Cryin over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
I'm turning off the radio  
  
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Yes, I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so done with love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Why can't I turn off the radio?


[Chorus]  
Are we growing up or just going down  
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out  
Take our tears and put them on ice  
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light  
  
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers  
Delivering just what you need  
We're well read and poised  
We're the best boys  
We're the chemists who've found the formula  
To make your heart swell and burst  
No matter what they say, don't believe a word  
  
Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it  
I'll keep singing this lie  
I'll keep singing this lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're traveled like gypsies  
Only with worse luck and far less gold  
The kids you used to love  
But then we grew old  
We're the lifers here til the bitter end  
Condemned from the start  
Ashamed of the way  
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up  
And another around to help us bend your trust  
I've got a sunset in my veins  
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
The best part of "believe" is the "lie,"  
I hope you sing along and you steal a line  
I need to keep you like this in my mind  
So give in or just give up  
  
Are we growing up or just going down  
  
[Chorus]


Yesterday you were on my back just to  
Get my time. I guess it's not as precious  
As it seems. because I found the time for  
Hangin' out and talking on the phone. what  
Should I expect, now that my time is free  
And you're nowhere to be found.  
  
next time I'll try, for the first time in my  
Life. it won't pass me by. procrastinate it  
Can wait, I put it off.  
Let's start today  
  
my room's a mess and I can't get  
Dressed. I gotta be out by eight o'clock.  
Deep inside I know the answer. well  
There's no time like the present and I'd  
Like to hang out but who doesn't. I've  
Made enough mistakes for this lifetime.  
Now I'm here to make amends.  
  
next time I'll try, for the first time in my  
Life. it won't pass me by. procrastinate it  
Can wait, I put it off.  
Start! stop!


Am I more than you bargained for yet?  
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear  
Cause that's just who I am this week.  
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum.  
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song.  
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)  
  
Drop a heart, break a name.  
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team.  
  
We're going down, down in an earlier round,  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging.  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it  
We're going down, down in an earlier round,  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging.  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it  
  
Is this more than you bargained for yet?  
Oh, don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet  
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans.  
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?  
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song  
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)  
  
Drop a heart, break a name  
We were sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team.  
  
We're going down, down in an earlier round  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it  
  
We're going down, down in an earlier round,  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging.  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it.  
  
Down, down in an earlier round  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging.  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it.  
  
We're going down, down in an earlier round  
(Take aim at myself)  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging  
(Take back what you said)  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
(Take aim at myself)  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it.  
  
We're going down, down (down, down)  
Down, down (down, down)  
We're going down, down (down, down)  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it.  
  
We're going down, down in an earlier round  
(Take aim at myself)  
And Sugar, we're going down swinging  
(Take back what you said)  
I'll be your number one with a bullet  
(Take aim at myself)  
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it.


Light that smoke for giving up on me  
And one just cause they'll kill you sooner than my expectations  
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar:  
"I could have died with you"  
I hope you choke on those words, that kiss, that bottle- I confess  
Now ash youself out on the insides, said I loved you but I lied  
  
Let's play this game called "When you catch fire"  
I wouldn't piss to put you out  
Stop burning bridges  
and drive off of them  
So I can forget about you  
  
So bury me in memory  
His smile's your rope  
Wrap it tight around your throat  
  
On the drive home  
Joke about the kid you used to see  
And his jealousy  
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool  
As when you wrap your car around a tree  
Your make up looks great next to his teeth  
  
Let's play this game called "When you catch fire"  
I wouldn't piss to put you out  
Stop burning bridges  
and drive off of them  
So I can forget about you  
  
So bury me in memory  
His smile's your rope  
Wrap it tight around your throat (2x)  
  
So bury me in memory  
around your throat


I'm a stitch away from making it  
And a scar away from falling apart, apart  
Blood cells pixelate, and the eyes dilate  
And the full moon peels, got me out on the street at night  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
  
Oh, put love on hold, Young Hollywood  
'Cause on the other line  
A nose runs ruby red, death's seen a double bed  
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
  
I'm a stitch away from making it  
And a scar away from falling apart, apart  
The blood cells pixelate, and the eyes dilate  
Kiss away all these thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
(Watch you work the room)  
  
(I'm a stitch away)


[Verse 1]  
Stuck in the jet wash,  
Bad trip I couldn't get off.  
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew,  
And overhead of the aqua blue.  
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture,  
Blessed be the boys time can't capture.  
On film or between the sheets,  
I always fall from your window,  
To the pitch black streets.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And with the black banners raised,  
As the crooked smiles fade.  
Former heroes who quit too late,  
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again.  
  
[Chorus]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again!  
I think you're my best friend,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm not passive but aggressive,  
Take note, it's not impressive.  
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse on my bedroom floor,  
We put your curse in reverse.  
And it's our time now if you want to to be,  
Maul the world like the carnival bears set free.  
And your love is anemic and I can't believe,  
That you couldn't see it coming from me.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I still feel that rush in my veins,  
It twists my head just a bit too thin.  
All those people I see in those old photographs I've seen are dead.  
  
[Chorus]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again!  
I think you're my best friend.  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
  
[Bridge]  
And sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah  
And let your dirty sadness fill me up, just like a balloon  
  
[Outro]  
And in the end, I'd do it all again,  
I think you're my best friend.  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?  
I'll be yours, when it rains it pours, stay thirsty like before,  
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?


Oh god!  
Sean Don  
Fall Out, Boi  
  
Did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh ooh  
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, oh,)  
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever  
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up,  
Pretty pout, pout  
Until you bottomed up, oh  
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together  
I'm singing  
  
Whoa  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
Oh how the mighty fall in love  
  
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme  
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams)  
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one  
Baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it  
(Gutter where we found it)  
'Cause your only crime is that you got caught  
I'm singing  
  
Whoa  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
Oh how the mighty fall in love  
  
It's getting clear  
You're never coming clean  
Lock you up inside, and swallow, swallow the key  
  
Hello?  
Yeah I know you said not to call unless I'm dying  
But I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids  
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you  
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through  
You know how we do  
  
Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay  
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper  
Baby straight up chemistry DNA  
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A  
Like, I let her climb on top  
I'm either fuckin or workin', so the grind don't stop  
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you  
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you  
  
Whoa  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
They fall in love  
How the mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
The mighty fall  
Oh how the mighty fall in love


I got my stitches stitched, I got my fixes fixed,  
In my aching heads I got my kisses slipped.  
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said, I said,  
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar and sent them back.  
It's true, romance is dead, I shot it in the chest then in the head.  
  
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend,  
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't
break.  
It was never about the songs, it was competition,  
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest  
  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
  
I'm casully-obsessed and I've forgiven death,  
I am indifferent yet (I'm a total wreck),  
I'm every cliche, but I simply do it best.  
  
And if you wanna go down in history then I'm your friend,  
Because they've got me in a band where I've never seen a heart I couldn't
break.  
It was never about the songs, it was competition,  
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest  
  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
  
(Go!)  
  
I went to sleep a poet, and I woke up a fraud,  
To calm your nerves I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark.  
  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.  
Which came first, the music or the misery?  
We're high-fashioned, we're last chances.


I'm holding out and I'm holding on  
To every letter and every song  
I pulled myself out of the day we ever had to meet  
Are you through with me?  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face?  
  
I'm all ears and I'm all scars  
To hear you tell me "Boys like you who try too hard to look not quite as
desperate"  
I'm hanging on  
But I still know the way to make your makeup run  
so  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face?  
  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And I'll take it to mine  
  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell


Put on your war paint  
  
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down  
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground  
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July setting fire to the sky  
Here, here comes this rising tide, so come on  
  
Put on your war paint  
  
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies  
Silver clouds with grey linings  
  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
  
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
  
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks  
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks  
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks  
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass  
  
So we can take the world back from a heart attack  
One maniac at a time we will take it back  
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start  
So dance alone to the beat of your heart  
  
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
  
Put on your war paint  
  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love  
  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love  
  
The war is won, before it's begun  
Release the doves, surrender love  
  
The war is won, before it's begun (Wave the white flag!)  
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)  
  
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
Wearing our vintage misery  
No, I think it looked a little better on me  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
  
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?  
I'm gonna change you like a remix  
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix  
  
Put on your war paint


Bury me standing under your window with the cinder block in hand  
Yeah cause no one will ever feel like this again  
And if I could move I'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you  
I must have dragged my guts a block...they were gone by the time we (talked)  
  
I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself  
But you know that I could crush you with my voice  
  
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me  
Hide the details I don't want to know a thing  
  
I hate the way you say my name like it's something secret  
My pen is the barrel of the gun. Remind me which side you should be on.  
  
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel.


Sometimes I wanna quit this song and become an accountant now  
But I'm no good at math and besides the dollar is down  
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold  
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town  
And get new passports and get get get get get out now  
  
All the yes men said no comment  
My mouth got going wrong way and all the calls started to roll in  
Like the time my dad caught me a horseshoe crab  
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town  
And get new passports get out now  
  
Tell that boy I leave you alone  
Like a storm, I 'll turn my love  
Suprah and the profit are both in the business of souls  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me  
Whoa I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town  
(I know we're gonna leave this town)  
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out  
Get, get, get, get, get out now


Baby, seasons change but people don't  
And I'll always be waiting in the back room  
I'm boring but overcompensate with  
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography  
  
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee?  
Don't pretend it, don't pretend  
  
(We don't fight fair)  
(We don't fight fair)  
  
They say your head could be your prison  
Then these are just conjugal visits  
People will dissect us till this doesn't mean a thing anymore  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
  
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee?  
Don't pretend it, don't pretend  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
(We don't fight fair)  
We don't fight fair  
(We don't fight fair)  
We don't fight fair  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
We don't fight fair  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
We don't fight fair


I am an arms dealer  
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words  
And I don't really care which side wins  
As long as the room keeps singing  
That's just the business I'm in  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
  
I wrote the gospel on giving up (You look pretty sinking)  
But the real bombshells have already sunk (Prima donnas of the gutter)  
At night we're painting your trash gold while you sleep  
Crashing not like hips or cars  
No, more like parties  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
Bandwagon's full, please catch another  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
  
All the boys who the dance floor didn't love  
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough  
Sing until your lungs give out  
  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Now you)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Wear out the groove)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Sing out loud)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race (Oh, oh)  
This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race  
  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate  
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate


I'm gonna make you bend and break (It sent you to me without wait)  
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll  
In case God doesn't show (Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)  
  
And I want these words to make things right  
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life  
Who does he think he is?  
If that's the worst you got, better put your fingers back to the key  
  
[Chorus]  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
One night, yeah, and one more time  
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories  
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter, oh  
  
Been looking forward to the future  
But my eyesight is going bad  
In these crystal balls  
It's always cloudy except for  
When you look into the past  
One night stand  
(One night stand)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(They say)  
I only think in the form of crunching numbers  
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers  
Get me out of my mind  
Get you out of those clothes  
I'm a letter away  
From getting you into the mood  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(One night, one more time)  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
One night, yeah, and one more time  
(One night, one more time)  
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories  
(For the memories, for the memories  
See, he tastes like you, only sweeter


[Jay Z]  
Yeah, what you critics said would never happen  
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it  
To the fans that held us down till everybody came around  
Welcome  
It's here  
  
Last summer we took threes across the board  
But by fall we were a cover story, "now in stores"  
Make us poster boys for your scene  
But we are not making an acceptance speech  
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes  
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
So long live the car crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me and fortify  
  
I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave  
Of my hand 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am  
The only thing I haven't done yet is die  
And it's me and my plus-one at the afterlife  
Crowds are won and lost and won again  
But our hearts beat for the die-hards  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me in forty-five  
  
So long live the car-crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
Fix me in forty-five  
  
Long live the car crash hearts  
(Long live the car crash hearts)  
Long live the car crash hearts  
(Long live the car crash hearts)  
  
Long live the car crash hearts  
Cry on the couch so all the poets come to life  
And fix me in forty-five  
  
[Jay Z]  
Young F-O-B  
Let's go


I'm not a cry baby  
I'm the cry baby  
A caterpillar that got stuck  
Mr. Moth come quick with any luck  
A long walk to a dark house  
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart  
I've got your body doing alright  
Hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art  
  
Oh, my friends all lie and say  
They only want the best wishes for me  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, baby you're a classic  
Like a little black dress  
You're a faded moon  
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)  
Whoa, whoa  
And oh, baby you're a classic  
Like a little black dress  
But you'll be faded soon  
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)  
Whoa, whoa  
  
I can make your heart slow  
I can feel the weather in my bones  
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like  
Your pupils they're big  
They're rolling like dice  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
(They only want the best for me)  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting, venting  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting, venting  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
(They only want the best for me)  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, whoa


[Intro]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I just need enough of you to dull the pain,  
To get me through the night until we're twins again,  
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again,  
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,  
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on,  
Keep making trouble 'till you find what you love,  
I need a new partner in crime and you're my shotgun.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Verse 2]  
A birth and a death on the same day,  
And honey I only appear so I can fade away.  
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream,  
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,  
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on.  
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck,  
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day.  
  
[Bridge]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Outro]  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.


[Intro]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle,  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Verse 1]  
The stench, the stench, of summer sex,  
And CK eternity, oh hell yes.  
Divide me down to the smallest I can be,  
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Verse 2]  
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb,  
It's worth two lions, but here I am.  
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams,  
But they're not quite what they seem.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
[Bridge]  
You'll find your way,  
And may death find you alive.  
Take me down the line,  
In Gem City we claim the tide.  
You'll find your way,  
And may death find you alive.  
Take me down the line,  
In Gem City we turn the tide.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Outro]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.


I'm a young one  
Stuck in the box  
Of an old ones head  
When all the others were just stirring awake  
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again  
  
Whoa  
My head's in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
[Chorus]  
Hurry, hurry  
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry  
What makes you so special?  
What makes you so special?  
I'm gonna leave you  
I'm gonna teach you  
How we're all alone  
(How we're all alone, how we're all alone)  
  
Give me, build me  
It's your club, so let me in (let me in) oh  
Knowing how heartwarming  
It is inside your skin  
  
My head's in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh  
Hmm, hmm,  
  
Baby, if you don't take your medication  
We won't sleep for days  
We won't sleep for days  
  
And Mama, when we pray to the Lord  
Doesn't sit or stay  
Doesn't sit or stay  
  
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car  
And I'm sunshine machine  
  
Uh, I want to get stuck, uh  
I want to get stuck  
And be  
In your memories.  
Hmm, oh


And you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out  
I wont, No. I'm sorry because you're old news  
  
And my life is holding our heads to this gun  
You and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off, but you're wrong  
  
I find myself on the street out in front of your house, you can kiss safe
thoughts goodbye.  
I'm coming up to break your heart.  
You're sleeping with the light on like you're dying to be found out.


Wishes bounce me weightless  
The infrared scope of pointlessness  
The bulls are sedated and this fights fixed  
  
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats  
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right  
The P.A. system keeps my hard heart beating tonight  
  
(Oh hell yes)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock once for the Father  
Twice for the Son  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
  
Come on in, the water's warm  
Come on like I sugared you, but with a kick in the head  
Like putting wings on lead  
Your eyes are black in my starlight  
I'm the last of my kind  
(And as always I'm not addicted to you)  
  
Follow the disorganized religion of my head  
And we'll never get through customs  
Let's just take off again instead  
  
Got my degree in the gutter  
My heart broken in the dorms of the Ivy League  
  
(Oh hell yes)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm a nervous wreck [Repeat: x3]  
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck  
(I'm a nervous wreck)  
I'm a nervous wreck  
(Oh hell yes)  
The drugs just make me reset  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Three times)  
Three times for the Holy Ghost  
(Three times)  
Three times for the Holy Ghost


I got troubled thoughts  
And the self-esteem to match  
What a catch, what a catch  
Whoa  
  
You'll never catch us  
So just let me be  
Said I'll be fine  
'Till the hospital or American Embassy  
Miss Flack said I still want you back  
Yeah, Miss Flack said I still want you back  
  
[Chorus]  
I got troubled thoughts  
And the self-esteem to match  
What a catch, what a catch  
And all I can think of  
Is the way I'm the one  
Who charmed the one  
Who gave up on you  
Who gave up on you  
  
They say the captain  
Goes down with the ship  
So, when the world ends  
Will God go down with it?  
Miss Flack said I still want you back  
Yeah, Miss Flack said I still want you back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What a catch  
What a catch  
What a catch  
What a catch  
  
I will never end up like him  
Behind my back, I already am  
Keep a calendar  
This way you will always know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where is your boy tonight?  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he won't find out what I know  
You were the last good thing  
We're going down, down in an earlier round  
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging  
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime  
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead  
Dance, this is the way they'd love  
If they knew how misery loved me  
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race  
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories  
Even though they weren't so great  
He tastes like you, only sweeter  
Growing up, growing up  
  
I got troubled thoughts  
And the self-esteem to match  
What a catch, what a catch


What's this? What's this?  
There's color everywhere  
What's this?  
There's white things in the air  
What's this?  
I can't believe my eyes  
I must be dreaming  
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair  
What's this?  
  
What's this? What's this?  
There's something very wrong  
What's this?  
There's people singing songs  
  
What's this?  
The streets are lined with  
Little creatures laughing  
Everybody seems so happy  
Have I possibly gone daffy?  
What is this?  
What's this?  
  
There's children throwing snowballs  
Instead of throwing heads  
They're busy building toys  
And absolutely no one's dead  
  
There's frost on every window  
Oh, I can't believe my eyes  
And in my bones I feel the warmth  
That's coming from inside  
  
Oh, look  
What's this?  
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss  
Why that looks so unique, inspired  
They're gathering around to hear a story  
Roasting chestnuts on a fire  
What's this?  
What's this?  
  
In here they've got a little tree, how queer  
And who would ever think  
And why?  
  
They're covering it with tiny little things  
They've got electric lights on strings  
And there's a smile on everyone  
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong  
This looks like fun  
This looks like fun  
Oh, could it be I got my wish?  
What's this?  
  
Oh my, what now?  
The children are asleep  
But look, there's nothing underneath  
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them  
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things  
Secure them in their dreamland  
What's this?  
  
The monsters are all missing  
And the nightmares can't be found  
And in their place there seems to be  
Good feeling all around  
  
Instead of screams, I swear  
I can hear music in the air  
The smell of cakes and pies  
Are absolutely everywhere  
  
The sights, the sounds  
They're everywhere and all around  
I've never felt this good before  
This empty place inside of me has been filling up  
I simply cannot get enough  
  
I want it, oh, I want it  
Oh, I want it for my own  
I've got to know  
I've got to know  
What is this place that I have found?  
What is this?


Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
I'm here to collect your hearts,  
It's the only reason that I sing  
I don't believe a word you say,  
But I can't stop listening  
  
This is the story of how they met,  
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes,  
And when she touched him he turned ruby red  
A story that they'll never forget  
Never forget  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,  
Girls are getting back rubs,  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become ex's again  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone  
I'm not gonna go home alone  
Where, where did the party go?  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na, yeah  
  
I know I expect too much  
And not enough all at once  
You know I only wanted fun  
And you got me all fucked up  
Oh no  
  
I looked for your name on the Ouija board  
And you're making magic oh dear lord  
You and me are the difference between real love  
And the love on TV, love on TV  
  
And all the boys are smoking Menthol's,  
Girls are getting back rubs,  
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough  
  
My old aches become new again  
My old friends become ex's again, yeah  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone

All the kids who screamed (we weren't the same)  
In sweaty rooms  
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs  
  
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema light  
So let's fade away together one dream at a time  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na,  
Na, na, na, na  
  
Oh where did the party go?  
We were ending it on the phone  
I'm not gonna go home alone  
Where, where did the party go?

I comb the crowd and pick you out  
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out  
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed  
To I swear, I say, to I swear, I say  
  
To hands between legs, to whatever it takes  
To drinks at the club, to the bar  
To the keys to your car  
To hotel stares, to the emergency exit door  
  
To the love, I left my conscience  
Pressed between the pages of a  
Bible in the drawer  
"What did it ever do for me?" I say  
  
It never calls me when I'm down  
Love never wanted me, but I took it anyway  
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy  
But never both, love never wanted me  
  
"I hoped you choked and crashed your car"  
Hey tear catcher, that's all that you are  
And ever were from the start  
I swear, I say  
  
To hands between legs, to whatever it takes  
To drinks at the club, to the bar  
To the keys to your car  
To hotel stares, to the emergency exit door  
  
To the love, I left my conscience  
Pressed between the pages of the  
Bible in the drawer  
"What did it ever do for me?" I say  
  
It never calls me when I'm down  
Love never wanted me, but I took it anyway  
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy  
But never both...love  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To my love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyhole, I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyholes, I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell (Kiss and tell)  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Pressed between the pages of the  
Bible in the drawer  
"What did it ever do for me?" I say


Shows)  
  
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters  
We never stood a chance  
And I'm not sure if it matters  
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons  
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town  
  
I know this hurts, it was meant to  
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one  
And it's mind over (you don't) matter  
  
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters  
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming  
Into microphones for attention  
Because we're just so bored  
I never knew that you would pick it apart, oh  
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts  
  
I used to obsess over living,  
Now I only obsess over you  
Tell me you'd like boys like me better  
In the dark lying on top of you  
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
