[Intro]  
Here we go!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I can't wait to smoke them all  
Whole pack like Marlboro  
Blow it in your face, blow it in your face  
Blow it in your, blow it in your face  
I can't wait to rev you up  
Faster than you can say "Ferrari"  
Tearin' up the gravel, watch you unravel  
Now it's a party  
  
Hey, I can't wait to cast my spell  
Which one you'll never tell  
'Cause I got it covered, city gravy southern  
Got you drippin' like no other  
  
[Chorus]  
Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceilin'  
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceiling  
A-YO, A-YO  
We smokin' 'em all  
A-YO, A-YO  
We smokin' 'em all  
A-YO, A-YO  
We smokin' 'em all  
A-YO, A-YO  
  
[Verse 2]  
I can't wait to blaze for real  
Track burns like a road rail  
Spin it in your face, spin it in your face  
Play it in your, play it in your face  
  
Can't wait to get you shook up  
Faster than you can try to hate it  
You can try to hate it, you can try to fake it  
But baby, I laced it  
  
[Chorus]  
Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceilin'  
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceiling  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' on 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Aaaa-YO  
  
[Refrain]  
A-YO, A-YO  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO A-YO  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
  
[Chorus]  
Get it da get it da get it get it  
Get off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceilin'  
Off on me, my body's got you pleadin'  
Light me up and breathe in  
Mirror on the ceiling  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
(We smokin' 'em all)  
A-YO, A-YO  
Mirror on the ceiling  
  
[Outro]  
A-YO, A-YO  
We smokin' 'em all  
A-YO, A-YO  
A-YO  
A-YO  
A-YO, A-YO  
We smokin' 'em all  
A-YO, A-YO  
Hey YO


I know that we are young,  
And I know that you may love me,  
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,  
Alejandro  
  
She's got both hands  
In her pocket  
And she won't look at you  
Won't look at you  
She hides true love  
En su bolsillo  
She got a halo around her finger  
Around you  
  
You know that I love you boy  
Hot like Mexico, rejoice  
At this point I gotta choose  
Nothing to lose  
  
Don't call my name  
Don't call my name, Alejandro  
I'm not your babe  
I'm not your babe, Fernando  
  
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch  
Just smoke my cigarette and hush  
Don't call my name  
Don't call my name, Roberto

Stop, please,  
Just let me go Alejandro,  
Just let me go  
  
She's not broken  
She's just a baby  
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad  
And all those flames that burned before him  
Now he's gonna fire fight, gotta cool the bad  
  
You know that I love you boy  
Hot like Mexico, rejoice  
At this point I've gotta choose  
Nothing to lose  
  
Don't call my name  
Don't call my name, Alejandro  
I'm not your babe  
I'm not your babe, Fernando  
  
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch  
Just smoke my cigarette and hush  
Don't call my name  
Don't call my name, Roberto

Don't bother me, Alejandro  
Don't call my name,  
Don't call my name, bye, Fernando  
I'm not your babe,  
I'm not your babe, Alejandro  
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,  
Fernando  
  
Don't call my name,  
Don't call my name, Alejandro  
I'm not your babe,  
I'm not your babe, Fernando  
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch

Since I become a shooting star  
I've been wondering where you are  
Seems like your forever in a getaway  
Momma told me that it would happen to me one day  
Feels like we've been apart for some light years  
Crater in my heart, filled with my tears  
Stars align, I'll be your girl again  
What I'm tryin say, I want you back in my world again  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
And I bet you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
Sitting watching time passing by me  
Voice in my head asking why me?  
I'm here wishing you would stop by my place  
But the only time we talk is on Myspace  
By the way, have you found my replacement?  
She should be the one on this spaceship  
Waking up, reaching for you when you're not there  
You got me in another galaxy, I'm out there  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
Oh boy I know you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
How can I get you outta my  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
System, my system, my system (If I could only get you)  
System, my system, my system (Outta my system baby)  
System, my system, my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you, yeah

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong  
To crash the critics saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"  
If only fame had an IV, baby could I bear  
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here  
  
I live for the applause, applause, applause  
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause  
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me  
The applause, applause, applause  
  
Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)  
Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)  
  
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch  
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch  
  
I've overheard your theory  
"Nostalgia's for geeks"  
I guess sir, if you say so  
Some of us just like to read  
  
One second I'm a Kunst  
Then suddenly the Kunst is me  
Pop culture was in art  
Now, art's in pop culture in me  
  
I live for the applause, applause, applause  
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause  
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me  
The applause, applause, applause  
  
Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)  
Give me that thing that I love (Turn the lights on)  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)  
  
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch  
(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud  
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch  
  
Ooh touch, touch ooh  
Touch, touch now ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
I live for the applause, applause, applause  
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause  
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me  
The applause, applause, applause

Come to me, in all your glamour and cruelty  
Just do that thing that you do  
And I'll undress you  
Give it time, sometimes the simplest move is right  
The melody that you choose, can rescue you  
  
A hybrid can withstand these things  
My heart can beat with bricks and strings  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP  
  
Come to me, with all your subtext and fantasy  
Just do that thing that you do  
In a perverse hue  
Lover's kites, are flown on beaches for public sight  
The color palette you choose, can profit you  
  
A hybrid can withstand these things  
My heart can beat with bricks and strings  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
Could try to sell you out or I  
Could show you all the reasons why  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP  
  
Brushes with darknes won't help you create  
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything  
I try to sell myself but I am really laughing  
Because I just want the music, not the bling  
Music, not the bling  
  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP  
  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)  
ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP  
  
Free my mind, ARTPOP  
You make my, heart stop

He's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have his charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Love's the same old sad sensation  
Lately I've not slept a wink  
Since this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again  
Beguiled again  
A simpering whimpering child again  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep  
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Lost my heart but what of it  
He is cold I agree  
He can laugh but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to him each spring to him  
And long for the day when I'll cling to him  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I  
  
Men are not a new sensation  
I've done pretty well I think  
But this half-pint imitation  
Put me on the blink  
  
I've sinned a lot  
I'm mean a lot  
But now I'm like seventeen a lot  
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I


Love is just a history that they may prove  
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you  
When Pontius come to kill the king upon his throne  
I'm ready for their stones  
  
I'll dance, dance, dance  
With my hands, hands, hands,  
Above my head, head, head  
Like Jesus, said  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
With my hands, hands,  
Hands above my head  
Dance together  
Forgive him before he's dead because  
  
I won't cry for you  
I won't crucify the things you do  
I won't cry for you, see  
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary  
  
We are not just art for Michelangelo  
To carve, he can't rewrite the aggro of my furied,  
Heart, I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris cold  
Je ne veux pas mourir toute seule  
  
I'll dance, dance, dance  
With my hands, hands, hands,  
Above my head, head, head  
Like Jesus, said  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
With my hands, hands,  
Hands above my head  
Dance together  
Forgive him before he's dead because  
  
I won't cry for you  
I won't crucify the things you do  
I won't cry for you, see  
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary  
  
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga

Cork's off, it's on  
The party's just begun  
I promise  
This drink is my last one  
I know I fucked up again  
Because I lost my only friend  
God forgive my sins  
Don't leave me, I  
Oh I will hate myself until I die  
  
My heart would break without you  
Might not awake without you  
Been hurting low, from living high for so long  
I'm sorry, and I love you  
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"  
I'll keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more than dope  
Need you more than dope  
Need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
  
Toast one last puff  
And two last regrets  
Three spirits and  
Twelve lonely steps  
Up heaven's stairway to gold  
Mine myself like coal  
A mountain of a soul  
Each day, I cry  
Oh, I feel so low from living high  
  
My heart would break without you  
Might not awake without you  
Been hurting low, from living high for so long  
I'm sorry, and I love you  
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"  
I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
I need you more than dope  
  
I need you more  
Need you more  
I need you more than dope


I never was the kind of girl,  
That's naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no!  
I was insecure, insecure!  
But when it comes to you and me  
I can't deny this feeling I'm feeling inside,  
Oh no, I've never been like this before!  
This before, oh, no!  
  
[Chorus]  
I seeing all the signs from above  
I'm going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love!  
Oh yeah  
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss,  
'Cause baby I was born to be his  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love (I love you)  
  
You know that I'd never cheat on a man  
'Cause I'm not like that  
I'm physically crafted to be  
As fitting as McQueen  
But when it comes to clothing a man  
I'm fashionably just designed to be rad  
Oh he's, no words that seem to mean  
What I mean, no no, no!  
No I just can't seem to forget you  
No I can't  
But just as long as I met you  
You're my babe right through  
I was made for you (I was made for you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say I need a strong man  
Not just a friend,  
But baby must have reached his death.  
No more reason to cry or to justify  
How I feel for you  
My love  
I seeing all the signs from above  
I'm going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Verse 1:  
Years ago we met by chance  
Thinking - we? D start the greatest love of all  
Both of us were in a trance  
Together we have been so strong  
Through the years I felt a change  
Suspecting? We could not keep our love alive  
Soon it all  
Became so strange  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
  
Verse 2:  
I shy away from love these days  
  
Because? I need to be alone for now  
We have to go different ways  
Then I may understand my faults  
I? M sure that it will take some time  
Until? I open up my heart again  
It? S so dark  
The sun won? T shine  
  
Chorus:  
You? Re gone  
But where I don? T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I? M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
I? D like to set off  
And follow your track  
But I know you would never come back  
All that remains  
At the end of the show  
Are footsteps you left in the snow


Making love in an ice cold room  
We start 'til the candle burns - gone  
Kissing each other 'til the moon says bye-bye  
And the sun says hello  
  
Lying here with no blanket  
The room's temperature is sub-zero  
Baby bring your body closer  
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, (keep) on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Sweat drippin' up our bodies, breathin' small  
While you're whispering to me  
Ice crystal in this small, small bed  
But we make frost when we're touching like that.  
  
Laying here with no blanket  
The room's temperature is sub-zero  
Baby bring your body closer  
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers.  
Frozen in time, our love lingers  
Livin' in a world so cold,  
Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles  
  
Being with you is all I need  
There's nothing we can't handle babe  
Lay on my chest, please cover me  
Deep frost, on this bed memories  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Freezer Burn...

All my friends are going out,  
But I've been thinking,  
Maybe I better stay in bed,  
The ceilings spinning round,  
Like I've been drinking,  
I've got this banging in my head  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
I need my Medicine  
And the cure aint aspirin  
  
I don't care about tomoro-o-o-o  
Here we go again, here we go again

Never wanna stay  
I I wish that I was there  
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)  
Never wanna stay

I sleep through the alarm  
Head under pillow  
I know I'm gonna pay for this  
I can't stand missing out  
So when you call me, call me  
I say okay if you insist  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
I need my Medicine  
And the cure aint aspirin  
  
I don't care about tomoro-o-o-o  
Here we go again, here we go again  
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-are

Your love is nothing I can't fight  
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine  
  
I'm in the bedroom,  
With tissues and when,  
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in  
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world  
And I'm a hard girl,  
Loving me is like chewing on pearls  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,

Won't go without my fix tonight  
It's a little too rough  
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines  
And she can't get enough  
  
I'm in the bedroom  
With tissues and when,  
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in  
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world  
And I'm a hard girl  
Loving me is like straightening curls  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,

I'm shiny and I know it,  
Don't know why you wanna blow it,  
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.  
  
I'm shiny and I know it,  
Don't know why you wanna blow it,  
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.  
  
Is it because you don't mean it?  
Or because I don't feel it?  
Yes it's rough.

[Verse 1]  
Do you feel, like you ever want  
To try my love and see how well it fits  
Baby can't you see, when you look at me  
I can't kick this feeling when it hits  
Oh all alone, in my bed at night  
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight  
I think of you and I dream of you, all of the time  
What am I gonna do?  
  
[Chorus]  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
I need your love, I need your love  
I need your love, I need your love  
I need your love, I need your love  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need  
I want your love, I need your love  
Just like the birds in the sky above  
I'll share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need  
I'll share my dreams  
And make you see  
How really bad your love I need  
  
[Chorus]  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)  
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)

You know I want your love  
You know I need your love  
You know I want your love  
You know I need your love  
You know I want your love  
You know I want your love  
I want your love, I want your love


I climb the mountain top, I saw the bottom drop.  
I cling to drift wood, I swim in the deep world.  
  
Words unspoken, seem so foreign.  
Have you heard this one?  
  
The hair on the back of your neck stands.  
Another way out, another way out...  
The army ants have escaped.  
The hair on the back of your neck stands up.  
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany.  
  
Fang bite tarantula, taste of my symptoms.  
Gasoline and a pistol, blood filling the bathtub.  
  
Swollen eyelids, baffled by this.  
Tell us what you see?  
  
The hair on the back of your neck stands.  
Another way out, another way out...  
The army ants have escaped.  
The hair on the back of your neck stands up.  
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany.  
  
I've bit my lip for the last time.  
Fog lifts up, for the blind.  
Free of body, free of mind.  
I'll build my mold up, rest inside  
  
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood.  
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood.  
  
The hair on the back of your neck stands up.  
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany.  
  
The army ants have escaped...  
  
The hair on the back of your neck stands up.  
Ink runs into my cup, I sip epiphany.  
  
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood.  
Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood.  
  
Now the killer is said to be gone  
Blood everywere scare me scare me  
Horror bubble horror scare  
Inks everywhere.  
  
Ants eating brain  
Bees Eating your heart  
Killer is me


Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
When he calls to me, I am ready  
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs  
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain  
Even after three times he betrays me  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown  
  
I'm just a holy fool,  
Oh baby it's so cruel but  
I'm still in love with Judas baby  
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas baby  
  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Juda-ah-as  
Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah  
  
I couldn't love a man so purely  
Even darkness forgave his goofy way  
I've learned love is like a brick you can  
Build a house or sink a dead body  
  
Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down  
Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown  
  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as  
  
In the most Biblical sense,  
I am beyond repentance  
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind  
But in the cultural sense  
I just speak in future tense  
Judas kiss me if offenced,  
Or wear an ear condom next time  
  
I wanna love you, but something's pulling me away from you  
Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to  
  
Just a holy fool, oh baby he's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby  
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel  
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Red wine, Konvict, Gaga (oh, yeah)  
  
I've had a little bit too much - much oh oh woah!  
All of the people start to rush, start to rush by.  
How does she twist the dance  
Can't find my drink, or man.  
Where are my keys, I lost my phone.  
What's going on out on the floor?  
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.  
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?  
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just dance, gonna be OK.  
Da da doo doo just dance spin that record babe.  
Da-da-doo-doo just dance, gonna be OK.  
Duh-duh-duh dance, dance, dance, just dance.  
  
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.  
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out right.  
Control your poison babe  
Roses have thorns they say.  
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.  
What's going on on the floor?  
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.  
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?  
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalog.  
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw.  
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady tryin' to pick it up like the car  
I'm a hit it, I'm a hit it and flex until the 'till done until tomorrow yeah.  
  
Shawty I can see that you got so much energy,  
The way you twirling up them hips round and round  
There's no reason, I know why you can't leave here with me  
In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down and dance  
  
Gonna be okay da-da-doo-doo  
Just dance, spin that record babe.

Fashion sense and vanity consume us cause we

New new, new new, New York,  
New new, new new, New York,  
New new, new new, New York,  
Sittin' here in my hotel room, I'm livin' the dream and look at you (HAH! )  
  
This, be, the city of dreams.  
This, is, more than I can handle,  
(But hey, I'm a city girl right?)  
I can't sleep,  
Must I,  
Dance all nightt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just woke up, I gotta recording,  
Stayed up all night  
Those clubs dun bore me,  
Irresistable, all the men at my door go  
Ring ring, ring ring ring(ding dong)  
Ring ring, ring ring ring(ding dong)  
  
Hey, just wanted your money,  
You got my drink,  
Have a pleasant morning,  
One night stand,  
Please don't come and lure me,  
A girl like me? you must be shittin',  
Get off my steps before  
I give you a beating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm livin' the dream,  
Livin' the dream,  
Livin' the, livin' the, livin' the dream.

I never ever thought I'd live away  
From everyone I love and say goodbye  
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train  
Where everybody here, they know my game  
But when I walk down the street I hear them say  
"There she goes, that crazy girl,  
She thinks she's something in this world"  
  
So I'ma close my ears and dream  
Cause life is never really what it seems  
In every mystery, there's a truth  
You know I'm tellin, I'm tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
You can't stop me  
You're never ever gonna stop me now  
  
On every street there is a memory,  
A time and place where we can never be again  
Street lights glow green, red, and yellow too  
Do you let signs tell you what to do?  
Yeah, when you say stop,  
Be sure that I'll say go  
To the stars in the land  
  
Fire can't burn these hands  
But I just close my eyes and dream  
You can't deny me my astronomy  
  
In every mystery, there's a truth  
You know I'm tellin, I'm tellin you  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
And you can't stop me  
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now  
  
Go ahead and don't believe  
Cause everyone needs a way to dream  
And love and you can't stop me  
No you can't stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own  
And you can't stop me  
You're never ever ever gonna stop me  
  
No matter lightning or thunder,  
Buckets of rainwater  
You can't flood this town  
  
In a world unknown  
You've gotta hold your own


I'm calling cause I need you.  
You know I need you so desperately.  
You know how bad I can get,  
And you know, how good I can be.  
  
I'm calling just to tell you,  
Get here and I'll make it worth your while.  
I can make you some food.  
Boy, and then I can make you smile.

And I've got nothing on for tonight.

Or you know what I will do.

When you get here, boy, we can dance.  
Our hands on the headboard, it's our defense.  
I've turned the lights down low,  
And I've got nothing on but the radio.  
  
Got too much time on my hands.  
Wait 'til I get my hands on you.  
  
'Cause I've got nothing on but the radio,  
And I've got nothing on for tonight.  
(Nothing) Nothing on but the radio,  
And I'm tuned into your station tonight,  
With me tonight.

Hold her hand through the black light  
Baby it's a forest land of trick slides  
Honey just take your time  
Close her eyes  
  
"I'm scared," she whispered  
As she wants to hide  
Into a back room where  
She paints on a smile  
She hears a sound  
She hears a sound  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody, uh-oh  
She waited for love  
But there wasn't anybody  
Around so she left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Keep it cool at the freakshow  
Baby it's a happy place  
If you lose it, honey  
Just take your time  
Close his eyes  
  
"Touch me," he whispered  
As he walks to the light  
From the window  
There's visions of  
A house in the night  
He hears a sound  
He hears a sound  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody, uh-oh  
He waited for love  
But there wasn't anybody  
Around so he left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Hold her, tell her that you need her  
Please undress her slowly, uh-oh  
Never hold the girl too tightly  
She can't breathe when you speak  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh  
We waited for love  
But there wasn't anybody  
Around so we left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Rock show, rock show, rock show


Oh oh oh yeah  
Babe  
  
Last time I thought we had this talk  
Boy you were getting ready to leave  
I thought that baby you were done  
Cause for a while you could barely look at me  
  
This time I thought that we'd be fine  
That I'd forget the things that you said  
I tried crossing out your words  
  
But baby you can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
Can not forget the past  
Oh oh oh oh, Still baby (Babe)  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
The second time around  
  
We tried going back to Joe's  
That always was our favourite place  
Long rides baby by the coast  
Do you remember where we stayed  
  
Last time we where hanging out  
You were acting kind of strange  
Now it's the second time around  
I'm sorry now it's me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh oh babe  
(My heart just speaks to me)  
It's me that feels this way  
Oh oh oh babe  
  
I now you are the one that is hurting  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
I'm not sure the best way to say this  
But I can't pretend to love you no more babe  
This ferris wheel's got me crazy  
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe  
Not meant for us babe hey-yeah!  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
You don't know what to think  
So unemotional  
Wonder if I'm even still in love  
You see  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder the second time around  
  
I'm so unpredictable  
Just like you used to be  
So unemotional  
Boy I can forget the way you were with me  
I don't know what to tell you now  
It's always harder  
The second time around

With bottom knocked back  
And your stone washed dice

I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies  
Call me kitty."

I can't help myself  
I'm addicted to a life  
Of fur-retrial  
It's some kind of joke  
I'm obsessively opposed to the  
Canine  
  
All we care about is  
Garbage cans, kitty beds and fishy foods  
Give me something, I wannabe  
Feline, Hollywood, yes we live for the  
  
Cats, doin' it for the cats  
'Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the spoilt and lazy  
Cats, doin' it for the cats  
'Cause we gotta taste for fishy treats  
And endless spoiling  
  
Cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats  
We live for the cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats  
Isn't it a shame, shame baby  
A shame, shame  
In it for the cats, cats baby  
The cats, cats

I can't help myself  
I'm addicted to a life of material  
It's some kind of joke  
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical  
  
All we care about is  
Runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles  
Give me something, I wanna be  
Retro glamor, Hollywood, yes we live for the  
  
[Chorus]  
Fame, doin' it for the fame  
Cause we wanna live the life

I can see myself in the movies  
With my picture in the city lights  
Photograph my mind  
And what else you like to shoot  
You decide  
  
All we care about is  
Pornographic girls on film and body plastic  
Give me something  
I wanna see television and hot blonds in odd positions  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
We live for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
Isn't it a shame, shame baby

In it for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
  
Don't ask me how or why  
But I'm gonna make it happen this time  
My teenage dream tonight  
Yeah I'm gonna make it happen this time  
  
Fame, doin' it for the fame  
Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the rich and famous  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Oh  
Tonight I'm gonna show  
Them what I'm made up for  
The killer queen inside me's  
Coming out  
Say, "Hello!"  
  
Oh  
Tonight I will return  
The fame and riches earned  
With you I'd watch them all be burnt  
Whoa-Oh, Whoa-Oh  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
I'm called a bitch in the night  
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win  
I am a woman, I insist it's my life  
  
[Chorus]  
I can be  
The queen that's inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you you'll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
I  
Wind and hurricane  
The stormy sky and rain  
When you run dry I'll flood your pain  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh  
  
In between the moments of  
The lady I've become  
A voice speaks through the noise like drums  
Rhomp-a-bump-a  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
I'm called a bitch in the night  
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win  
I am a woman, I insist it's my life  
  
I can be  
The queen that's inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you you'll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
The quee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-een  
The que-ee-een  
Quee-ee-een  
Quee-ee-een  
  
Starry night come inside me like never before  
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door  
I will fly on a challenger across the sky  
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Whoa, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh


I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn (2x)  
  
He's begging me to come with him  
I don't know why  
When I'm with this I feel free  
Like a monster that could fly  
  
Through the skies I come in  
Through the skies I feel free (baby)  
Like an unicorn can blow my horn (2x)  
  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my head?  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my brain?  
I'm not sure to give my to another body  
Well, he's innocent I can't blame  
  
Unicorn Unicorn  
Innocent  
In the dark  
Unicorn  
Unicorn  
Be afraid of the souls  
Be far  
  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my head?  
I'm not sure  
Will he take my brain?  
I'm not sure to give my to another body  
Well, he's innocent I can't blame  
  
I got my shadow tonight  
Is like a horse  
An unicorn is dirtying the hope horn (2x)


It's funny how things, they change, the clouds they part, rearrange for me  
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free  
Cuz yeah this room is crowded but I am so alone in it, help me please  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
And I will be strong  
I won't give in  
I won't deny you  
I know where we've been  
  
I am so much more  
Than all of my fears  
Than all of these tears  
My tears, yeah  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here


If I fell in love you,  
Would you understand me dear,  
Love is weird.  
I coloured you a valentine,  
Struggled just to stay inside the lines,  
I loose my mind.  
  
I really can't believe  
I lost myself again  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
  
I wrote a song about your eyes,  
Ate a slice of cherry pie,  
I cried all night.  
On a bench inside the park,  
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark,  
I'll never stop.  
  
I really can't believe  
I lost myself again  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
  
Baby take me for a ride  
Baby get a little high  
In a place we've never been  
Time is nothing but a line  
We leave everything behind  
It be so wonderful  
Wonderful  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful I am  
You know wonderful I am  
Wonderful I am  
Wonderful I'm


You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve  
Coming here when I'm still with him  
And I can't have you, it isn't fair  
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming  
And if I had one wish  
Yeah, you'd be it  
  
When you're 'round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
You've got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Again and again  
Again, again, again, again  
Never stop again and again  
Again, again, a a again, again  
Never stop, oh  
  
He never really saw me  
Or waited when we were hooking up  
Yeah he'd a never last  
Last week when I was sad  
You said that you knew  
My eyes change from kinda green  
To kind blue, hey yea  
  
When you're 'round  
I lose myself inside your mouth  
You've got brown eyes  
Like no one else  
Baby make it to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey tell me if I leave him  
Baby would you be there  
'Cause maybe you could  
Be more than that, all the time  
I'm sad chillin'


[Verse 1]  
I confess I am lost  
In the age of the social  
On our knees, take a test  
To be lovin' and grateful  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shots were fired on the street  
By the church where we used to meet  
Angel down, angel down  
But the people just stood around  
[Chorus]  
I'm a believer, it's a trial  
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
I'm a believer, it's chaos  
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
  
[Verse 2]  
Doesn't everyone belong  
In the arms of the sacred  
Why do we pretend we're wrong?  
Has our young courage faded?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shots were fired on the street  
By the church where we used to meet  
Angel down, angel down  
Why do people just stand around?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a believer, it's a trial  
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
I'm a believer, it's chaos  
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
  
[Bridge]  
Who, who, who, who, who  
Who, who, who, who, who  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a believer, it's a trial  
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
I'm a believer, it's chaos  
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh  
I'd rather save an angel down  
  
[Outro]  
Save that angel  
Hear that angel  
Catch my angel  
Save that angel  
Hear that angel  
Catch my angel  
Hear that angel  
Hear that angel  
Catch my angel  
Save that angel  
Hear that angel  
Catch my angel  
Hear that angel  
Catch my angel


I killed my former and  
Left her in the trunk on highway ten  
Put the knife under the hood  
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
Aura-a-a-a aura-a-a-a  
Aura-a-a-a aura-a-a-a  
Aura-a-a-a aura-a-a-a  
  
I'm not a wandering slave I am a woman of choice  
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face  
You ought to pity me 'cause was always one man to love  
But in the bedroom the size of him's more than enough  
  
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?  
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?  
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?  
  
Enigma pop star is fun, she wear burqa for fashion  
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion  
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil  
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?  
  
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech  
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech  
  
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?  
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?  
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?  
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?  
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burga


We don't care what people say  
We know the truth  
Enough is enough with this horse shit  
I am not a freak  
I was born with my freedom  
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom  
  
I'm a bitch, I'm a loser baby, maybe I should quit  
I'm a jerk, wish I had the money but I can't find work  
I'm a brat, I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked  
My parents tried till they got divorced  
'Cause I ruined their lives  
  
I'm a bad kid  
And I'll survive  
Oh I'm a bad kid  
Don't know wrong from right  
I'm a bad kid and this is my life  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
(This is my life)  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
A bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
Don't be insecure  
  
I'm a twit, degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it  
Pump your fist  
If you would rather mess up than put up with this  
I'm a nerd, I chew gum and smoke in your face I'm absurd  
I'm so bad and I don't give a damn, l love it when you're mad  
When you're mad  
When you're mad  
  
I'm a bad kid  
And I will survive  
Oh I'm a bad kid  
Don't know wrong from right  
I'm a bad kid and this is my life  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
(This is my life)  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
A bad kid baby  
Don't be insecure  
  
I'm not that typical baby  
I'm a bad kid like my Mom and Dad made me  
I'm not that cool and you hate me  
I'm a bad kid that's the way that they made me  
  
I'm a bad kid I'm disastrous  
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath  
I'm a bad kid and I will survive  
One of the bad kids  
Don't know wrong from right  
  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
Don't be insecure  
If your heart is pure  
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby  
  
[Repeat: x5]  
A bad kid, baby

In the glass of her boudoir

"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,

And love your friends

Hey there sugar baby  
Saw you twice at the pop show  
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll  
I like you a lot lot  
Think you're really hot hot  
  
I know you think you're special  
When we dance real crazy  
Glamaphonic, electronic, disco baby  
I like you a lot lot  
All we want is hot hot  
  
[Chorus]  
Boys boys boys  
We like boys in cars  
Boys boys boys  
Buy us drinks in bars  
Boys boys boys  
With hairspray and denim  
Boys boys boys  
We love them! (We love them)  
  
Oh, oh  
  
Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers  
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers  
I like you a lot lot, think you're really hot hot  
Let's go to the party heard our buddy's the DJ  
Don't forget my lipstick I left it in your ashtray  
I like you a lot lot, all we want is hot hot  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm not loose, I like to party  
Let's get lost in your Ferrari  
Not psychotic or dramatic  
I like boys and that is that  
Love it when you call me legs  
In the morning buy me eggs  
Watch your heart when we're together  
Boys like you love me forever  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus: x3]


[Verse 1]  
I always thought it was you,  
You always thought it was me.  
We always thought we were it,  
Seemed like a real perfect fit,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
I always thought even though,  
We were so young we could grow.  
Up in the end it'd be us,  
We'd take the F or the bus,  
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I miss our cheap chandalier  
'Member when dad hung it there?  
And we would watch Rocky IV,  
The one where the Russian scored,  
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair.  
  
I'd call you my champion  
Thought we had already won  
And cracked open our last beer,  
Falling asleep in our tears,  
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Bridge]  
I found an old pair of  
Keys in my purse that opened  
The walkup we shared  
How did they get there, jerk?  
I wanna see you there  
I wanna make it work.  
  
I didn't brush my hair  
And my lashes are falling  
Off of seven years  
Of our bad luck dating.  
I want one last night there,  
A Brooklyn Night affair.  
  
[Chorus]  
Its not that I don't wanna love you  
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)  
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death  
When we used to be  
Brooklyn Nights happy.  
  
[Outro]  
Its not that I don't want to love you  
Cause I really tried, and I  
Just wanna hang with the old you  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu.  
  
Have a drink with your former self  
We both won't act like someone else  
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth  
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu


In your brown eyes, walked away  
In your brown eyes, couldn't stay  
In your brown eyes, you watch her go  
  
And turn the record on  
And wonder what went wrong  
What went wrong  
  
If everything was everything  
But everything is over  
Everything could be everything  
If only we were older  
  
Guess it's just a silly song about you  
And how I lost you  
And your brown eyes  
  
In your brown eyes, I was feeling low  
Cause they're brown eyes and you never know  
Got some brown eyes, but a soft face  
  
I knew that it was wrong  
So baby, turn the record on  
Play that song  
  
Where everything was everything  
But everything is over  
Everything could be everything  
If only we were older  
  
I guess its just a silly song about you  
And how I lost you  
And your brown eyes  
  
Brown eyes  
  
Everything was everything  
But baby it's the last show  
Everything could be everything  
But it's time to say goodbye so  
Get your last fix, and your last hit  
Grab your old girl with her new tricks  
  
Honey yeah, it's no surprise  
I got lost in your brown eyes  
  
In your brown eyes  
Brown, brown eyes  
Your brown eyes  
Brown, brown eyes  
Got some brown eyes  
Brown, brown eyes  
Your brown eyes


One look and I'm done  
One glance from your eyes  
And I'm captivated  
  
The taste of your skin  
The warmth of your hungry lips  
Has me so taken and I  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
  
When I'm with you I'm so sedated  
I'm captivated by you  
  
You're just like the wind 'cuz  
Everything moves away when you're around it  
  
The sun is just like the sound of  
your voice in the morning  
When you light my world up and I  
Love the way you can make me dance From miles away  
  
When I'm with you I'm never jaded,  
I'm captivated  
  
Oh,  
I'll never stop believing  
In this crazy love we're leading  
Oh, sugar,  
Hold me closer,  
Make me sweeter,  
I need ya,  
I love you  
  
So, please, show me that smile  
Make me laugh for just a little while  
Then breathe me one breath  
I only need one to fill the emptiness  
  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
It's been so long but now,  
I've waited and I'm captivated

Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
And I,  
Don't wanna be the kind to cry  
I wanna dance right through the night  
You get me through these ch-changing skies  
  
Know, that I am not emotional  
It's just that I don't wanna fall  
Without my parachute tonight  
  
Give me something that I  
Can wrestle to the ground  
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-e-ow  
Believe me when I say  
That I Will Be Okay  
And listen that's advised  
And my ch-changing skies  
  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing

Silicone, saline, poison inject me  
Baby, I'm a free bitch, I'm a free bitch  
  
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track  
She won't walk away but she won't look back  
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess  
She's a mess she's a mess  
Now the girl is stressed  
She's a mess she's a mess  
She's a mess she's a mess (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin  
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him  
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a tramp  
She's a tramp she's a vamp  
But she still does her dance  
She's a tramp she's a vamp  
But she still kills the dance  
(Tell 'em, girls)  
  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
In the dark she loves to dance in the dark  
In the dark she loves, she loves to dance in the dark  
  
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia  
Tell 'em how you feel girls!  
  
Work your blond (Jean) Benet Ramsey  
We'll haunt like Liberace  
Find your freedom in the music  
Find your Jesus, find your Cupid  
You will never fall apart  
Diana, you're still in our hearts  
Never let you fall apart  
Together we'll dance in the dark  
  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
Baby, baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark in the dark


[Intro]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Verse 1]  
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time  
I fell down, I wish you were mine  
I close my eyes  
Take a breath and I picture us in a place  
I can't recognize  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In the fire I call your name out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)  
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm singin'  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Verse 2]  
I fool myself  
Swirl around as if I'm someone else  
Your hands are mine  
I do a trick  
Pretend that I am you until it clicks  
I come alive  
Come alive  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In the fire I call your name out  
(call your name out, call your name out)  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (call your name out)  
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (rub the pain out)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm singin'  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Bridge]  
Hurts inside, but not this time  
All the things that are on my mind  
Vanish as I touch myself  
Call out loud for you  
Oh, can you hear me singin'?  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin'  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown


[Verse 1]  
Young, wild, American  
Lookin' to be somethin'  
Out of school go-go'n  
For a hundred or two  
Some asshole broke me in  
Wrecked all my innocence  
I'll just keep go-go'n  
And this dance is on you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
One, five, ten, lay a million on me  
Before the end of this song  
[Chorus]  
Young, wild, American  
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?  
Rain on me a million  
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
Young, wild, American  
Head full of Jameson  
Girl's playin' bad 'cause it doesn't pay to be good  
A cruel king made me tough  
Daddy's girl's never good enough  
I'll just keep go-go'n  
'Cause this dance is on you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
One, five, ten, lay a million on me  
Before the end of this song  
  
[Chorus]  
Young, wild, American  
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?  
Rain on me a million  
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Good thing I know what I'm worth  
Want a good thing, put the money down first  
Better get a good look baby  
'Cause soon I'm breaking out of here  
  
[Chorus]  
Young, wild, American  
C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?  
Rain on me a million  
I'm not flawless, but I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
Oh, I  
I might not be flawless, but you know  
I gotta diamond heart  
  
[Outro]  
Diamond heart


Ha ow ha ow ha ow haaaaaaaaaa baby this is my life  
When I walk out the door I see you baby you are not in my life  
I wanna hold em' like they do in texas plays  
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me (I love it)  
Luck and intuition play the cards with spades to start  
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his hearti  
Have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
This is my life  
And babe, there's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
There's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
I wish you'd never looked at me that way  
Eh eh, eh eh  
There's nothing else I can say  
Eh eh, eh eh  
My my my my life  
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
Don't play too much just as that kid  
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick  
  
Touch me t-touch me baby but don't mess up my hair  
Love me l-love me crazy  
But don't get too attached, this is a brink affair  
My life  
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)  
Vanity (there is a camera, so many beauty queens)  
Vanity (it's so good to be)  
Popular and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else  
Va-va-va-va-vanity va-vanity, va-va-va-vanity  
My life so shut up  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game  
Let's play a love game, baby love game  
When you want love, when you want fame  
Though you in a game, though in a love game  
This is my life.

In this proud land we grew up strong  
We were wanted all along  
I was taught to fight, taught to win  
I never thought I could fail  
  
No fight left or so it seems  
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted  
I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have fans  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good  
  
Though I saw it all around  
Never thought I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be the last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home  
The place that I was born, on the lakeside  
As daylight broke, I saw the earth  
The trees had burned down to the ground  
  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up  
We don't need much of anything  
Don't give up  
'Cause somewhere there's a place  
Where we belong  
  
Rest your head  
You worry too much  
It's going to be alright  
When times get rough  
You can fall back on us  
Don't give up  
Please don't give up  
  
'Got to walk out of here  
I can't take anymore  
Going to stand on that bridge  
Keep my eyes down below  
Whatever may come  
And whatever may go  
That river's flowing  
That river's flowing  
  
Moved on to another town  
Tried hard to settle down  
For every job, so many men  
So many men no-one needs  
  
Don't give up  
'Cause you have fans  
Don't give up  
You're not the only one  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up now  
We're proud of who you are  
Don't give up  
'Cause I believe there's the a place  
There's a place where we belong


What if I were to leave you  
But then you fell back in love with me  
  
How could you ever let me go  
How could you ever ever let me go  
I scream your name across the bar  
I carry pictures of your  
Neil young  
Guitar  
Though I just can't seem to forget you  
Not ever just as long as I left you  
Your my baby, you  
Never made it through to you

And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet

Left here on this planet  
If there was an earthquake  
Maybe then you'd love maybe then you'd love me  
If there was an earthquake

I didn't mean to hurt you  
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh eh  
  
I have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) I wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh)  
  
Not that I don't care about you  
Just that things got so complica- eh eh  
I met somebody cute and funny  
Got each other and that's money, eh eh  
  
I have something that I love long-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Eh, eh)  
I have something that I love long-long so-long  
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh, there's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh)  
  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) Wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
(Eh, eh) Wish you never looked at me that way  
(Eh, eh) There's nothing else I can say  
  
Cherry cherry, boom boom  
Eh eh, oh yeah  
All I can say is eh, eh

[Chorus]  
If you want me  
Meet me at electric chapel  
If you want me

If you wanna steal my heart away  
Meet me, meet me baby in a safe place  
Come on meet me  
In electric chapel  
  
Come dance to me where you have been  
Next to the bar  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Pray for your sins  
Right under the glass disco ball  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Follow me  
Don't be such a holy fool  
Follow me

Together we'll both find a way  
To make it pure  
Love working in dirty way

We are a generation twisted by our myth  
Confused and ludicrous, holding on to love  
Consumed by all the pleasures in our midst  
A life without the lips we've kissed  
And losing all control  
  
We're gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
We're gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss  
  
Fame is our felony  
We're so in love with it  
Superstars and masochists  
Who don't know where to go  
But the poets and the fathers of our time  
Put down their weapons in their arms  
And know what they must do  
  
We're gonna start a resistance  
So we want independence  
We're gonna give the world some of this  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice forever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
  
Electric kiss  
I'm gonna change the world with my lips  
One voice for ever  
We'll live together  
Peace, love, solitude and happiness  
Electric kiss

And took hand off you up in the middle of the day

Cuz when I'm with you I fall apart,  
I see your permanently broken heart.  
Baby, your the greatest to me,

Sometimes a story has no end  
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends  
'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me  
  
And what about our future plans?  
Does it seem we have even make sense?  
When I got the whole world in front of me  
  
So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I love gypsy life  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
Maybe we can see the world together  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight, tonight"  
  
So I just packed my baggage and  
Said goodbye to family and friends  
And took the road to nowhere on my own  
  
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick  
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick  
'Cause I left everyone I love at home  
  
And I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I love gypsy life  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
Maybe we can see world together  
I don't wanna be alone forever  
But I can be tonight, tonight  
  
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy, I'm  
  
And then he asked me,  
Said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"  
I said, "Honey, it's simple.  
It's the way that you love and treat your mother"  
  
Thought that I would be alone forever  
But I won't be tonight  
I'm a man without a home  
But I think with you I can spend my life  
And you'll be my little gypsy princess  
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset  
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets  
'Cause it's you and me  
Baby, for life  
  
Would you go with me?  
(For life)  
See the world with me  
  
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy I'm  
  
Russia, UK, Paris, I'm  
Italian, Asian, Kompai  
Africa, India, I'm  
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy I'm  
Latin American, I don't speak German but I try  
Someday in Jakarta, I'm  
American, I'm gypsy I  
Bangkok, Australia, Malaysia  
Sweden, Finland, Norway  
Be my home just for the day  
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy hey


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa  
  
Whenever I'm dressed cool  
My parents put up a fight  
(Uh huh, uh huh)  
And if I'm hot shot  
Mom will cut my hair at night  
(Uh huh, uh huh)  
  
And in the morning  
I'm short of my identity  
(Uh huh, uh huh)  
I scream Mom and Dad  
Why can't I be who I wanna be?  
(Uh huh, uh huh) to be  
  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to love me for who I am  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to know, I am my hair  
  
[Chorus]  
I've had enough, this is my prayer  
That I'll die living just as free as my hair  
I've had enough, this is my prayer  
That I'll die living just as free as my hair  
I've had enough, I'm not a freak  
I'm just here trying to stay cool on the streets  
I've had enough, enough, enough  
And this is my prayer, I swear  
I'm as free as my hair  
I'm as free as my hair  
I am my hair, I am my hair  
  
Free as my hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair

Free as my hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair  
Hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair  
  
Sometimes I waltz around  
Put on red highlights  
Just because I want my friends  
To think I'm dynamite  
  
And on Friday rocks in  
High school dance  
I got my bangs too hot  
That I don't stand a chance, a chance  
  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to love me for who I am  
I just wanna be myself  
And I want you to know, I am my hair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Free as my hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair

Free as my hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair  
Hair, hair, hair  
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair  
  
I just want to be free, I just want to be me  
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties  
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed  
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bare  
  
I am my hair, I am my hair  
I am my hair, I am my hair  
I am my hair, I am my hair  
I am my hair, I am my hair  
It's all the glory that I bare

My hair, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, my hair, my hair

I want your whiskey mouth  
All over my blond self  
Red wine, cheap perfume  
And a filthy pout  
  
Tonight bring all your friends

Let's have a full house of leather

Let's raise hell in the streets  
Drink beer and get into trouble

You're so hot, but not to taste  
Happy lovers on display  
Baby, we were born this way

Listen, I've got the sickest ambition.  
Deep in the mirror I am scared,  
Don't know who the hell is there.  
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection.  
  
Obsession  
  
The thing it's our new religion.  
Each model and celebrity  
Changes how I look at me.  
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me  
I'll never be  
  
A superstar 'cause I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
In Hollywood, In Hollywood  
  
Women, let's talk about our condition.  
How beauty's a commodity,  
Women don't get the best things,  
Battered liver though, with poison.  
  
I am the bill.  
In the world without me, this vision.  
Sure Hollywood's commercially amorous  
But naturally, me? Quite ugly as hell.  
Tell me I'm not sixteen!  
  
Like a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
  
Within a year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
  
Within the year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like superstars, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
In Hollywood, Hollywood  
Hollywood, HollywoodLike a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
  
Within the year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like superstars, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
In Hollywood, Hollywood

I've got a reason that you who should take me home tonight  
  
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong  
  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Right on the limits where we no we both belong tonight  
  
It's hard to feel the rush  
To push the dangerous,  
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge  
Where we can both fall over in love  
I'm on the edge, of glory  
And I'm hanging on the moment of truth  
I'm on the edge  
The edge x6


[Tony Bennett]  
It don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
It don't mean a thing  
All you got to do is sing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
It makes no difference  
If it's sweet or hot  
  
[Tony Bennett]  
Just give that rhythm  
Everything you got  
  
[Both]  
Oh, it don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)


[Verse 1]  
Take my hand, stay Joanne  
Heaven's not  
Ready for you  
Every part  
Of my aching heart  
Needs you more  
Than the angels do  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?  
[Verse 2]  
If you could  
I know that you'd stay  
We both know  
Things don't work that way  
I promised I  
Wouldn't say goodbye  
So I grin  
And my voice gets thin  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?  
  
[Bridge]  
Honestly, I know where you're goin'  
And baby, you're just movin' on  
And I'll still love you even if I can't  
See you anymore  
Can't wait to see you soar  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?  
Girl  
Where do you think you're goin'?  
Where do you think you're goin'  
Goin', girl?


[Intro: Spoken]  
It's like, I just love a cowboy  
You know  
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad  
But I'm just like  
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse  
And can you go a little faster?!  
  
[Verse 1]  
3 am, mustang speedin'  
Two lovers, headed for a dead end  
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs  
Runnin' through the red lights  
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'  
Big swig, toss another beer can  
Too lit, tonight, prayin'  
On the moonlight  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every John is just the same  
I'm sick of their city games  
I crave a real wild man  
I'm strung out on John Wayne  
  
[Chorus]  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)  
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)  
Baby let's get high, John Wayne  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)  
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)  
Baby let's get high, John Wayne  
  
[Verse 2]  
Blue collar and a red-state treasure  
Love junkie on a three-day bender  
His grip, so hard, eyes glare  
Trouble like a mug shot  
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission  
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'  
He called, I cried, we broke  
Racin' through the moonlight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every John is just the same  
I'm sick of their city games  
I crave a real wild man  
I'm strung out on John Wayne  
  
[Chorus]  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)  
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)  
Baby let's get high, John Wayne  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)  
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)  
Baby let's get high, John Wayne  
  
[Bridge]  
So here I go  
To the eye  
Of the storm  
Just to feel your love  
Knock me over  
Here I go  
Into our love storm  
  
[Chorus]  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)  
(dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)  
Baby let's get high, John Wayne  
(dat - doo - deet - doe)

Baby let's get high, John Wayne

He looked at me and cried  
Said something broke inside of you  
Were my best friend  
Whatever come our way  
You know I'm your gal 'till the e-e-end  
  
When I finally go away  
I know you'll look for me one day

But you know that I'm around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Get a little love down  
Let it down oh oh  
  
I can't remember when  
You put your hands on mine  
But couldn't play in time when we  
We're not together  
Just sing a little song  
Blueberry kisses foreve-e-er  
  
When I finally go away  
I know you'll look for me one day  
  
Oh yeah it's so sad

I've got no friends  
I'm my own queen  
But I'm living on, living on the the radio  
That's my dream  
  
Stone river eyes  
And a lonely heart  
If I'm living on the radio  
They won't tear me apart  
  
10 steps and roses on the tree  
10 steps and lonely nights  
But you've still got me  
On the road  
Road paved in gold  
  
Baby you must believe  
Baby you must be free  
Keep living on, living on the radio  
That's my dream  
  
Baby you've gotta friend  
And so many little monsters, yeah  
Keep living on, living on the radio  
  
And when there's nowhere to go  
And all your friends are gone  
And you only got your daddy to call  
It will be all right, honey  
'Cause your songs are on the radio  
  
'Cause the showbiz, all the caviar  
The champagne and the sold out shows  
But it will be all right honey  
'Cause your songs are on the radio

I'm gonna marry the night  
I won't give up on my life  
I'm a warrior queen  
Live passionately tonight  
  
I'm gonna marry the dark  
Gonna make love to the stark  
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness  
I am a winner  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm not gonna cry anymore  
I'm gonna marry the night  
Leave nothing on these streets to explore  
M-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
  
I'm gonna lace up my boots  
Throw on some leather and cruise  
Down the street that I love  
In my fishnet gloves  
I'm a sinner  
  
Then I'll go down to the bar  
But I won't cry anymore  
I hold my whiskey up high  
Kiss the bartender twice  
I'm a loser  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna marry the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing's too cool  
To take me from you  
New York is not just a tan  
That you'll never loose  
  
Love is the new  
Denim or black  
Skeleton guns  
Or wedding bells in the attic  
  
Get Ginger ready  
Climb the El Camino front  
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels  
'Cause that's where we make love  
  
Come on and run  
Turn the car on and run  
  
I'm gonna marry the night  
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road  
I'm gonna marry the night  
Leave nothin' on these streets to explode  
M-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
  
Oh m-m-marry m-m-m-marry m-m-m-marry the night  
I'm gonna marry, marry  
I'm gonna marry, marry  
Come on, come on  
  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night, the night  
The night, the night


[Verse 1]  
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go  
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show  
You're givin' me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
  
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills  
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still  
But you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
[Chorus]  
I bow down to pray  
I try to make the worst seem better  
Lord, show me the way  
To cut through all his worn out leather  
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby, I just need one good one to stay  
  
[Verse 2]  
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare  
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware  
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
  
And if you say something that you might even mean  
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe  
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
  
[Chorus]  
I bow down to pray  
I try to make the worst seem better  
Lord, show me the way  
To cut through all his worn out leather  
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby, I just need one good one to stay  
  
[Bridge]  
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy  
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'  
Stay, ehh, ehhy  
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'  
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith  
But baby, I just need one good one  
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one  
  
[Chorus]  
When I bow down to pray  
I try to make the worst seem better  
Lord, show me the way  
To cut through all his worn out leather  
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby, I just need one good one, good one  
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one  
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

There was a boy...  
A very strange enchanted boy  
  
They say he wondered very far, very far  
Over land and sea  
  
A little shy and sad of eye  
But very wise was he  
  
And then one day  
One magic day, passed my way  
  
And as we spoke of many things,  
Fools and kings,  
This he said to me  
  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"  
  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"


I saw a shadow,  
And I knew that it wasn't mine  
  
You and her, I know that you were intertwined  
Even though her clothes were on and everything  
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both  
To blame  
  
Don't say a word, I'm sure that it won't  
Be enough  
To erase what I know  
Just happens now what dreams are made of  
  
This is my house and I won't allow the disrespect  
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you  
  
Cause baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say?  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw that day  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way ay-ay-ay  
No way ay-ay-ay  
No way ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
And then I saw something I know did not belong to me  
But then I thought there was no way you would do that to me  
And then last week when you went outside to use your phone  
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold  
  
And I just woke up but I wish that it was a nightmare  
'Cause when I have those it isn't real like this one is  
This is my heart and I won't allow the disrespect  
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you  
  
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
Get your things and go  
You can take the dinner leftover from last night  
I made you your favorite goodbye  
  
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
Ehh-heeeeeeyyyyyy-ohhhhhhhh-noo way  
No way

(Verse 1)I am the One, One, One oh oh! I can bring the roofs down One by One.
But I can't be won. I can't stop myself from being the first One, first One.
Being the One is fun. But my job here is not done.  
  
[Chorus:] We're in the club being who we are. After that we'll go to the bar.
The One thing I know about you is that you are the One to two.  
  
[Verse 2:] Ooo I'm thinking about the wonderful times we've had but my friends
are bad. I've kept too many secrets from everyone but you and I will always
have fun. I'm just One of a kind. You know the One!  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:] The thing that everyone says about that shit today I am not the One
who is gay. Judas is our demon that's not a sin, but don't try to make your
heart made out of tin.  
  
[Chorus:] You shit-talk but I'm gonna take a walk you are mean enough to pay
the One, the One  
(One, One, One, One)


The way you take over the floor  
Your style, your grace, I'm wanting more  
The way you move under the strobe  
Has got me losing all control  
  
I see you from across the room  
There's nobody in this place but you  
Just take my hand, let me take you away  
By the music is going and going

I've been waiting to get with you all night

So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
So take your time, don't be afraid  
I just take your hand and grab my way  
Get close to me, I feel the heat  
Boy you 'bout to drive me insane  
  
I feel your heart beating with mine  
The mood, the space, the stars align  
So take my hand, let me take you away  
By the music is going and going  
  
Can I have this dance  
I've been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you

So caught up in the rhythm, the way that you moving

I was walking along, minding my business,  
When out of the orange colored sky,  
Flash, bam, alacazam, Wonderful you came by.  
  
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,  
When out of that orange colored view  
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.  
  
Oh one look and I yelled timber.  
Watch out for flying glass.  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
I've been hit, This is it, this is it.  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham, bam, alacazam,  
Out of the orange colored sky  
  
Oh, one look and I yelled timber.  
Watch out for flying glass.  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
I've been hit, This is it, this is it.  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham, bam, alacazam,  
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka dot sky  
Flash, bam, alacazaaam,  
And good bye, good bye.


We are the crowd  
We're c-coming out  
Got my flash on it's true  
Need that picture of you  
It's so magical  
We'd be so fantastical  
  
Leather and jeans  
We're rock glamorous  
Not sure what it means  
But this photo of us  
It don't have a price  
Ready for those flashing lights  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm your biggest fan  
I'll follow you until you love me  
Papa-paparazzi  
Baby there's no other superstar  
You know that I'll be  
Your papa-paparazzi  
Promise I'll be kind  
But I won't stop until that boy is mine  
Baby you'll be famous  
Chase you down until you love me  
Papa-paparazzi  
  
I'll be a girl backstage at your show  
Velvet ropes and guitars  
Yeah 'cause you're my  
Rockstar in between the sets  
Eyeliner and cigarettes  
  
Shadow is burnt  
Yellow dance and we turn  
My lashes are dry  
Purple teardrops I cry it don't have a price  
Loving you is cherry pie  
Cause you know that baby I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Real good  
(We're dancing in the studio)  
Snap snap to  
(That shit on the radio)  
Don't stop  
(For anyone)  
We're plastic but we still have fun!  
  
[Chorus]


Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand  
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan  
Remembering me, before it began  
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam  
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop  
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops  
A superwoman chick, you know that I am  
Some shit don't fly by me in a man  
  
'Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real, as fabulous  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
  
Got something really shiny to start  
Want me to sign there on your range rover heart?  
I've heard it before  
Yeah, the dinners were nice  
Till your diamond words melted into some ice  
  
You should been rapping to the beat of my song Mr. California,  
Paper gangsta and I'm lookin' for love, not an  
Not an empty page full of stuff that means nothing but  
You've been played  
  
'Cause I do not accept any less  
Than someone just as real, as fabulous  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Won't sign away my life to  
Someone whose got the flavor  
But don't have no follow through  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Wont sign no monkey papers  
I don't do funny business  
Not interested in fakers  
  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta  
Oh oh  
Don't want no paper gangsta

We could have been perfect  
We could have been perfect  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
Now this is klling us  
  
I need you, but I don't need you  
I just need you to go, I want you, but I don't want too  
I just wanna let it go  
  
I know it's easier said then done  
I keep pretending that I've moved on  
And after all these lies,  
I keep telling myself  
Help me from falling,  
I'm broken, not perfect and it hurts  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
Now this is klling us  
  
I tried to forget you  
Don't wanna forget you  
So I keep forgetting too improfections,  
Why do you let them hurt you? You know they were hurting me too  
  
I know it's easier said then done  
I keep pretending that I've moved on  
And after all these lies,  
I keep telling myself  
Help me from falling,  
I'm broken, not perfect and it hurts  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
Now this is klling us  
  
Day by day, I would run away  
The clock ticks, but doesn't change  
Are we living?  
Or just existing?  
Afraid to face our fears  
  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
But you let it, let it go  
Could of been happy and still alive  
Now I'm going through hell in his single life  
We could of been perfect  
If you let it  
Now this is klling us.


Leave the coffin open when I go  
Leave my prose and lipstick on so everybody knows  
Pretty will be the photograph I leave  
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all all the dark  
I'll swallow each peroxide shot  
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself  
Maybe I'll just clean the shit of these fancy shoes  
I'll be a princess di and die with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish that I was strong  
I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart  
I've been trying to tell you how I feel  
But was never very smart  
I'm wrapped in silks made for egyptian queens  
I'll do it in the swimming pool  
So everybody sees  
  
Bleach out all the dark  
I'll swallow each peroxide shot  
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself  
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes  
I'll be a princess di and die with you  
  
Princess die  
I want to see her cry  
Princess die  
Princess die  
We want to watch her cry  
Princess die  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish that I was strong  
I wish that I was wrong  
I wish that I could cope  
But I took pills and left a note  
  
[Bridge:]  
But I took pills and left a note  
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo  
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold  
With the paparazzi all swarming around  
In my louis vuiton white buttoned down  
Oh it's not that deep  
So bob your head for another dead blonde  
Who's real prince is in heaven  
She just wants to sleep  
  
The final act of life will be my own hands to do,  
I'll be a princess die and die with you  
Applaud. Approve


1, 2  
I think I love you  
You got ripped jeans  
I'm only 19  
What do you wanna do?  
  
You got your cigarette  
I got my headset  
We're two of a kind  
You're spades and I'm diamonds  
And you know that too  
  
Yeah you can see clearly  
That I am the one you want  
But I must admit that  
I'm everything you're not  
  
Yeah I am red, you are blue  
I'm old school and you're so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When you're cold, I like to burn  
I cut lines, you wait you turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Don't shoot  
My heart is on mute  
Our physical dream  
Is only skin deep  
How do you wanna groove?  
  
Bang Bang  
Should hear my gun ring  
You're mine, you're there  
You'll hear that  
I am all up inside your head  
  
Now I can see clearly  
That I am the one you want  
But I must admit that  
I'm everything you're not  
  
Yeah I am red, you are blue  
I'm old school and you're so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When you're cold, I like to burn  
I cut lines, you wait your turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
You won't forget me when I'm gone  
This feels so good, it can't be wrong  
I recommend a one night stand  
I know we're just friends  
But you're my kind of man  
Just for tonight  
Just for tonight  
Just for tonight  
  
Even though I'm red, you are blue  
I'm old school and you're so new  
I know we could be great for tonight  
When you're cold, I'll make it burn  
You'll never have to wait your turn  
Yeah I guess I could forgive you tonight  
  
Yeah I am red, you are blue  
I'm old school and you're so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When you're cold, I like to burn  
I cut lines, you wait your turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I'm not bad, I just sound that way  
  
All the girls they like their presents, like their presents  
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons  
Doesn't matter if their precious or expensive  
If their well thought out, sexed up, wrapped right.  
Everytime, get in line, and give me mine.  
  
We like black, white, big, striped, poka-dotted, cafe-lotted.  
Ribbons come in many sizes, wrap em up in ribbons.  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up  
  
I'm not a allmark card expression, need material attention.  
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons, silly ribbons ribbons ribbons  
If you can't afford the best  
Don't be stressed, take a rest  
Get a job, do it right  
It's my birthday all night  
We like black, white, big, striped  
Famous super-sized ribbons  
Don't care what you put inside them  
Wrap it all in ribbons  
It's the lifestyle that I like  
I'll give you yours, you give me mine  
But don't forget to wrap 'em all in pretty pretty ribbons  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up  
  
Only difference between downtown and uptown  
Is therapy and valium, therapy and valium.  
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous  
Yeah it's therapy and valium, therapy and valium  
  
(It's not complicated  
Just a fashion statement  
Everybody wrap it up  
Everybody wrap it up) 4x  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up

Your not scary but you looks like ugly  
So take a mess

Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud


[Verse 1]  
I came down the mountain  
Draggin' our love affair  
Put on a pretty little number  
I'm wearing you still  
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast  
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me  
He has a funny way saying forever too fast  
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp  
For something he don't have  
I get on my knees and beg you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
It's the only one I know  
It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
[Verse 2]  
Got a baby sister who looks just like me  
She wants nothing more than a man to please  
Maybe she's in too deep  
Her love for him ain't cheap  
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece  
From Fulton Street  
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants  
He's thirsty when he drinks  
Gets on the brink, and throws her off  
I get on my knees and beg you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
It's the only one I know  
It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
  
[Bridge]  
I can carry you, but not your ghosts  
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
It's the only one I know  
It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
  
I love that lavender blond  
The way she moves the way she walks  
I touch myself can't get enough  
And in the silence of the night  
Through all the tears and all the lies  
I touch myself and it's alright  
  
Just give in don't give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time eh-eh eh-eh  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend

Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh ye-ha, ye-ha  
Eh-eh, eh-eh aha-aha  
  
I am as vain as I allow I do my hair  
I gloss my eyes I touch myself all through the night  
And when something falls out of place  
I take my time I put it back  
I touch myself 'til I'm on track  
  
Just give in don't give up baby  
Open up your heart and your mind to me  
  
Just know when that glass is empty  
That the world is gonna bend  
  
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine  
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time  
  
So happy I could die be your best friend  
Yeah I'll love you forever  
Up in the clouds we'll be higher than ever eh-eh, eh-eh

How, how, how, how, how  
  
I can't believe what you said to me  
Last night when we were alone  
You threw your arms up  
Baby you gave up, you gave up  
  
I can't believe how you looked at me  
With your James Dean glossy eyes  
In your tight jeans with your long hair  
And your cigarette stained lies  
  
Could we fix you if you broke?  
And is your punch line just a joke?  
  
I'll never talk again  
Oh boy you've left me speechless  
You've left me speechless, so speechless  
And I'll never love again  
Oh boy you've left me speechless  
You've left me speechless, so speechless  
  
I can't believe how you slurred at me  
With your half wired broken jaw  
You popped my heart seams  
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams  
  
I can't believe how you looked at me  
With your Johnnie Walker eyes  
He's gonna get you and after he's through  
There's gonna be no love left to rye  
  
And I know that it's complicated  
But I'm a loser in love  
So baby raise a glass to mend  
All the broken hearts  
Of all my wrecked up friends  
  
I'll never talk again  
Oh boy you've left me speechless  
You've left me speechless, so speechless  
  
I'll never love again  
Oh friend you've left me speechless  
You've left me speechless, so speechless  
  
How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow  
Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow  
  
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to  
Would you give it all up?  
Could I give it all up for you?  
  
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through  
Would you give it all up?  
Could you give it all up?  
  
If I promised boy to you  
That I'll never talk again  
And I'll never love again  
I'll never write a song  
Won't even sing along  
I'll never love again  
  
How, how, how so speechless  
You left me speechless, so speechless baby  
  
Will you ever talk again?  
Oh boy, why you so speechless?  
You've left me speechless, so speechless  
  
Some men may follow me  
But you choose "death and company"  
Why you so speechless? Oh oh oh

She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight (I am starving)  
She loves the theater, but she never comes late  
I never bother, with people that I hate  
That's why this chick is a tramp  
  
She doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls  
And I definitely won't dish out dirt, with the rest of those girls (Thank-you)  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I love the free, fresh wind in my hair  
Life without care, oh I'm so broke, it's old  
I hate California, it's crowded and damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp (I am a tramp)  
  
Sometimes I go to Coney Island, oh the beach is divine  
And I love the Yankees, Jeeter's just fine  
I follow Rogers and Heart, she sings every line  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
I love a prizefight, that isn't a fake (no fakes)  
I love to row boat with you and your wife on Central Park lake  
She goes to Opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)  
That's why this lady is a tramp  
  
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes  
What can I lose, 'cause I got no dough (oh no?)  
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
  
Go!  
  
I love your free fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair  
Life without care, but I am so broke, that's oak  
Hates California it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
That's why this lady is a tramp  
That's why the lady is a tramp


[Verse 1]  
You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time  
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together, you'll be fine  
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?  
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
'Til It happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels  
  
[Verse 2]  
You tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong  
Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on  
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?  
Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke  
  
[Chorus 2]  
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
No it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
Won't know how I feel  
  
[Bridge]  
'Til your world burns and crashes  
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope  
'Til you're standing in my shoes  
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you  
Cause you don't know  
  
[Chorus 3]  
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel  
How I feel  
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
No it won't be real  
(How could you know?)  
Won't know how it feels  
  
[Outro]  
Til it happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
Happens to you  
(How could you know?)  
Til it happens you  
You won't know how I feel


Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, whoa oh-oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh  
  
I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets that I used to own  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh-oh oh, a oh oh oh  
  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh-oh oh, a oh-oh oh  
  
It was the wicked and a wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I've become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my blonde head on a silver plate  
Just a Gaga on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be queen?  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
My missionaries hiding in foreign trenches  
  
For some reason that I can't explain  
I know Yves Saint Laraunt no he won't call my name  
Never an h-h-h-h-honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Now I'm doing my very best not to mess up all the words but,  
A strong apology to Coldplay, but I think otherwise it's a good job  
  
Oh, oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh,  
Oh oh-oh oh,  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
The Fame won't change us if we don't let it  
  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Mary won't call my name  
Never an h-honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world, ruled the world,  
Ru-you-u-uled the world.  
Viva La Vida


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten,  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white


Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say no man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on  
We'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the other kiddies knock him down  
  
When it snows  
Ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland


I won't break down today  
Another brick's in my way of shadows  
The promises they made  
Regret themselves and say this is too hard  
  
Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed  
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me  
  
So let the sound bring me back  
Sounds have no regrets  
And before you know it  
  
I'll take your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
  
Right to the stars and beyond  
Your words and be gone  
I'll take your words and be gone  
  
Whenever you're afraid  
Or someone's far away, never give in  
'Cuz happily, we'll reign  
When consequences change, believe you can win  
  
Yeah they say you grow when you don't succeed  
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me  
  
So let the sound bring me back  
Sounds have no regrets  
And before you know it  
  
I'll take your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
  
Right to the stars and beyond  
Your words and be gone  
I'll take your words and be gone  
  
Let the sound bring me back  
Sounds have no regrets  
And before you know it  
  
I'll take your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
  
Right to the stars and beyond  
Your words and be gone  
I'll take your words and be gone  
  
Your words and be gone  
Your words and be gone  
I'll take your words and be gone

It's been a long time since I came around  
Been a long time but I'm back in town  
And this time I'm not leaving without you  
  
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh  
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll  
This time I'm not leaving without you  
  
You say sit back down where you belong  
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on  
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time  
And you said to me there's,  
  
(Something), something, something about this place  
(Something), something about lonely nights  
And my lipstick on your face  
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy  
Yeah something about baby you and I  
  
It's been two years since I let you go  
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll  
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart  
  
On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold  
With a guitar humming and no clothes, I'd rather die  
This time I'm not leaving without you  
  
Sit back down where you belong  
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on  
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time  
And you said to me there's  
  
(Something), something, something about this place  
(Something), something about lonely nights  
And my lipstick on your face  
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy  
Yeah something about baby you and I  
  
You and I  
You you and I  
You you and I  
You you and I  
  
You and I  
You you and I  
Oh yeah, we're gonna die  
Without you and I  
  
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent  
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven  
There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life  
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ  
Born to run you down  
  
(Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years)  
I am a New York woman born to rock you down  
So want my lipstick all over your face  
(Something), something, something about just knowing when it's right  
So put your dreams up for Nebraska  
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you  
  
You and I  
You you and I  
Baby I'd rather die  
Without you and I  
  
You and I  
You you and I  
Nebraska  
I'd rather die  
Without you and I  
  
It's been a long time since I came around  
Been a long time but I'm back in town  
And this time I'm not leaving without you
