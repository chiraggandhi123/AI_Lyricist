All that I'm living for  
All that I'm dying for  
All that I can't ignore alone at night  
  
I can feel the night beginning  
Separate me from the living  
Understanding me  
After all I've seen  
Piecing every thought together  
Find the words to make me better  
If I only knew how to pull myself apart  
  
All that I'm living for  
All that I'm dying for  
All that I can't ignore alone at night  
All that I'm wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
I believe that dreams are sacred  
Take my darkest fears and play them  
Like a lullaby  
Like a reason why  
Like a play of my obsessions  
Make me understand the lesson  
So I'll find myself  
So I won't be lost again  
  
All that I'm living for  
All that I'm dying for  
All that I can't ignore alone at night  
All that I'm wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
Guess I thought I'd have to change the world  
To make you see me  
To be the one  
I could have run forever  
But how for would I have come  
Without mourning your love  
  
All that I'm living for  
All that I'm dying for  
All that I can't ignore alone at night  
All that I'm wanted for  
Although I wanted more  
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me  
  
Should it hurt to love you  
Should I feel like I do  
Should I lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me


You are everything I need to see  
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me  
Laugh and come and look into me  
Drips of moonlight washing over me  
Can I show you what you want from me  
  
Angel of mine, can I thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel, I must confess  
It's you that always gives me strength  
And I don't know where I'd be without you  
  
After all these years, one thing is true  
Constant force within my heart is you  
You touch me, I feel I'm moving into you  
I treasure every day I spend with you  
All the things I am come down to you  
  
Angel of mine  
Let me thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel, I must confess  
It's you that always gives me strength  
And I don't know where I'd be without you  
  
Back in the arms of my angel  
Back to the peace that I so love  
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest  
Giving you a gift that you remind me  
  
Angel of mine  
Let me thank you  
You have saved me time and time and time and time again  
Angel, I must confess  
It's you that always gives me strength  
And I don't know where I'd be without you  
  
Angel of mine  
Can I thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel, I must confess  
It's you that always gives me strength  
And I don't know where I'd be without you  
... Without you


Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you  
I am nothing more than to see you there  
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away  
We'll be lost before the dawn  
  
If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love  
Then let me never ever wake again  
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away  
We'll be lost before the dawn  
  
Somehow I know that  
We can't wake again from this dream  
It's not real, but it's ours  
  
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away  
We'll be lost before the dawn  
  
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away  
We'll be lost before the dawn


How can I pretend that I don't see,  
What you hide so carelesslly,  
I saw her bleed,  
And you heard me breathe,  
And I froze inside myself,  
And turned away,  
I must be dreaming  
  
We all live, we all die,  
That does not begin to justify you  
  
It's not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
No, I must be dreaming,  
It's only in my mind,  
Not real life,  
No, I must be dreaming  
  
Help you know I've got to tell someone,  
Tell them what I know you've done,  
I fear you, but spoken fears can come true  
  
We all live, we all die,  
That does not begin to justify you  
  
It's not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
No I must be dreaming,  
It's only in my mind,  
Not real life,  
No I must be dreaming  
  
We all live,  
We all die,  
That does not begin to justify you  
  
It's not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
No I must be dreaming,  
It's only in my mind,  
Not real life,  
No I must be dreaming  
  
Not what it seems,  
Not what you think,  
I must be dreaming,  
Just in my mind,  
Not real life,  
I must be dreaming.


I've been looking in the mirror for so long,  
That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side.  
All the little pieces falling, shatter.  
Shards of me,  
Too sharp to put back together.  
Too small to matter,  
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces.  
If I try to touch her,  
And I bleed,  
I bleed,  
And I breathe,  
I breathe no more.  
  
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well.  
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child.  
Lie to me,  
Convince me that I've been sick forever.  
And all of this,  
Will make sense when I get better.  
but I know the difference,  
Between myself and my reflection.  
I just can't help but to wonder,  
Which of us do you love.  
So I bleed,  
I bleed,  
And I breathe,  
I breathe no  
Bleed,  
I bleed,  
And I breathe,  
I breathe,  
I breathe  
I breathe no more.


How can you see into my eyes, like open doors  
Leading you down into my core  
Where I've become so numb, without a soul  
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold  
Until you find it there and lead it back home  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Now that I know what I'm without  
You can't just leave me  
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life, I've been living a lie  
There's nothing inside, bring me to life  
  
Frozen inside without your touch  
Without your love, darling  
Only you are the life among the dead  
  
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see  
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me  
  
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems  
I've got to open my eyes to everything  
  
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul  
  
Don't let me die here  
There must be something wrong, bring me to life  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside  
Bring me to life


Hi I'm Robby's sister, I guess that's plain to see  
When we watch cartoon cartoons, I'm happy as can be  
I think samurai Jack is cool, And Dexter's laboratory  
I miss watching power puff, I miss watching T. V.  
  
Well livin' the tour bus ain't that bad  
But I feel like I lost all that, I have  
  
On Cartoon Network, I miss you so  
On Cartoon Network, where did you go  
Grim and evil, how I love that little brain  
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?  
  
I hope you've learned a lesson here  
Treasure what you have, don't make the mistake I made  
The rockstar life is sad  
  
Well, livin' on the tour bus is, pretty bad  
And now I'm sure I know, the meanin' in my life  
The love within my soul  
The reason I wake up each day, and it's:  
  
Cartoon Network, I miss you so  
My Cartoon Network, where did you go  
My Cartoon Network


I found a grave  
Brushed off the face  
Felt your light  
I remember why I know this place  
  
I found a bird  
Closing her eyes  
One last time  
And I wonder if she dreamed like me  
  
Well, as much as it hurts,  
Ain't it wonderful to feel?  
So go on and bring your wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
I'm not afraid  
I push through the pain  
And I'm on fire  
I remember how to breathe again  
  
As much as it hurts  
Ain't it wonderful to feel?  
So go on and bring your wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?  
I will find a way even without wings  
Follow your heart till it bleeds  
As we run towards the end of the dream  
  
Follow your heart  
Till it bleeds  
And we've gone to the end of the dream


My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams  
Twenty bucks should get me through the week  
Never said a word of discontentment  
Thought it a thousand times but now I'm leaving home  
  
Here in my shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay where I don't belong  
  
Two months pass by and it's getting cold  
I know I'm not lost, I'm just alone  
But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now  
Waking up is knowing who you really are  
  
Here in my shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay where I don't belong  
  
In the shadows  
I'm safe, I'm free  
I've nowhere else to go but  
I cannot stay here  
  
Show me the shadow where true meaning lies  
So much more dismay in empty eyes


I took their smiles and I made them mine.  
I, I sold my soul just to hide the light.  
And now I see what I really am,  
A thief a whore, and a liar.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
I'm numb to you numb and deaf and blind.  
You give me all but the reason why.  
I reach but I feel only air at night.  
Not you, not love, just nothing.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
Try to forget you,  
But without you I feel nothing.  
Don't leave me here, by myself.  
I can't breathe.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away,  
Farther away,  
Father away,  
Father away,  
Father away,  
Father away.


Can you forgive me again  
I don't know what I said  
But I didn't mean to hurt you  
  
I heard the words come out  
I felt that I would die  
It hurts so much to hurt you  
  
Then you look at me  
You're not shouting anymore  
You're silently broken  
  
I'd give anything now  
To kill those words for you  
Each time I say something I regret  
I cry I don't want to lose you  
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah!  
  
'Cause you were made for me  
Somehow I'll make you see  
How happy you make me, Oh!  
  
I can't live this life  
Without you by my side  
I need you to survive  
So stay with me  
You look in my eyes  
And I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry [sorry]  
  
[Ooh I'm sorry]  
  
And you forgive me again  
You're my one true friend  
And I never meant to hurt you


She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak  
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks  
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black  
  
Hey! Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey! Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Your advice  
  
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet  
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath  
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black  
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back  
  
Hey! Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey! Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
  
Your advice  
Your advice  
Your advice


Playground school bell rings again  
Rain clouds come to play again  
Has no one told you she's not breathing?  
Hello I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to  
Hello  
  
If I smile and don't believe  
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream  
Don't try to fix me I'm not broken  
Hello I'm the lie living for you so you can hide  
Don't cry  
  
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping  
Hello I'm I'm still here  
All that's left of yesterday


  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take  
Every feeling that I get  
But I haven't missed you yet  
  
Every room-mate kept awake  
By every silent scream we make  
All the feelings that I get  
But I still don't miss you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it...  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take hn  
Every feeling that I get  
But I haven't missed you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it...  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Only when I start to think about you I know  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
I hate, you hate  
I hate, you love me  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you


Where's the light  
Killed my day  
Lost in the dark of your ways  
Wasting my energy, endlessly  
On your sweet lie  
  
And if you don't mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And, if you don't mind  
I would love to slip away and leave your world behind  
  
Feel secure, I'm not so sure  
You're not just faking something  
Wasting our last day  
I can't take the pain  
  
And if you don't mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And, if you don't mind  
I would love to slip away and leave it all behind  
  
And if you don't mind  
I would like to live the lie that I will survive  
And if you don't mind  
If you don't mind


I linger in the doorway  
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name  
Let me stay  
Where the wind will whisper to me  
Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story  
  
In my field of paper flowers  
And candy clouds of lullaby  
I lie inside myself for hours  
And watch my purple sky fly over me  
  
Don't say I'm out of touch  
With this rampant chaos your reality  
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge  
The nightmare I built my own world to escape  
  
In my field of paper flowers  
And candy clouds of lullaby  
I lie inside myself for hours  
And watch my purple sky fly over me  
  
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming  
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights  
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming  
The goddess of imaginary light


Jealous of the girl who caught your eye  
One of my darker days  
When you looked at her where was I?  
Shoulda been in her place  
Here I am  
All alone imagining what could have been  
If I had been there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jealous of the one who'se arms are around you  
If she's keeping you satisfied  
Jealous of the one who finally found you  
Made your sun and your stars collide  
La la la la la la la  
She's a very very lucky girl  
La la la la la la la  
  
  
Jealous of the one who won your heart  
They say it's a perfect match  
She's gonna get to be where you are  
And I don't get better than that  
She'll say you're fine  
Whisper words I wish were mine  
And they might have been  
If I had been there  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
You know I'd fight the good fight  
If I thought I'd change your mind  
But if she makes you happy  
I would leave that dream behind  
Man, she better treat you right  
And give you everything  
Cause at the moment she doesn't  
I'll be waiting in the wings  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
La la la la la la la  
She's a very very lucky girl


Out on your own, cold and alone again  
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?  
  
Blame it on me, set your guilt free  
Nothing can hold you back now  
  
Now that you're gone, feel like myself again  
Grieving the things I can't repair and willing  
  
To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free  
I don't want to hold you back now, love  
  
I can't change who I am, not this time  
I won't lie to keep you near me  
And in this short life there's no time to waste on giving up  
My love wasn't enough  
  
And you can blame it on me, just set your guilt free, honey  
I don't want to hold you back now, love


Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear  
Sealed with lies through so many tears  
Lost from within, pursuing the end  
I fight for the chance to be lied to again  
  
You never were strong enough  
You you never were good enough  
You were never conceived in love  
You will not rise above  
  
[Chorus]  
They'll never see  
I'll never be  
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger  
Burning deep inside of me  
  
But through my tears breaks a blinding light  
Birthing a dawn to this endless night  
Arms outstretched, awaiting me  
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree  
  
Rest in me and I'll comfort you  
I have lived and I died for you  
Abide in me and I vow to you  
I will never forsake you  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Stay alive, soft, dark and dreamless  
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness  
I hate me for breathing without you  
I don't want to feel anymore for you  
  
Grieving for you, I'm not grieving for you  
Nothing real love can't undo  
And though I may have lost my way  
All paths lead straight to you  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
  
Halo blinding wall between us  
Melt away and leave us alone again  
Humming haunted somewhere out there  
I believe our love can see us through in death  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
There's room inside for two  
And I'm not grieving for you  
I'm coming for you  
  
You're not alone  
No matter what they told you  
You're not alone  
I'll be right beside you forevermore  
  
I long to be like you, sis  
Lie cold in the ground like you did  
There's room inside for two  
And I'm not grieving for you  
  
And as we lay in silent bliss  
I know you remember me  
  
I long to be like you  
Lie cold in the ground like you  
There's room inside for two  
And I'm not grieving for you  
I'm coming for you


[Rain]  
Listen, listen  
Listen, listen  
Listen, listen  
Listen, listen  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
Listen to each drop of rain (listen, listen)  
Whispering secrets in rain (listen, listen)  
Frantically searching for someone to hear  
Their story before they hit ground  
Please don't let go  
Can't we stay for a while  
It's just too hard to say goodbye  
Listen to the rain  
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen to the rain  
Weeping  
Oooooooooooooooooooh  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
Listen (listen), listen (listen)  
I stand alone in the storm (listen, listen)  
Suddenly sweet words take hold (listen, listen)  
Hurry they say for you haven't much time  
Open your eyes to the love around you  
You may feel you're alone  
But I'm here still with you  
You can do what you dream  
Just remember to listen to the rain  
Oooooooooooooooooooh  
Listen  


You don't remember my name  
I don't really care  
Can we play the game your way?  
Can I really lose control?  
  
Just once in my life  
I think it'd be nice  
(Just to lose control, just once)  
With all the pretty flowers in the dust  
  
Mary had a lamb  
His eyes black as coals  
If we play very quiet, my lamb  
Mary never has to know  
  
Just once in my life  
I think it'd be nice  
(Just to lose control, just once)  
  
If I cut you down to a thing I can use  
I fear there will be nothing good left of you  
  
Just to lose control, just once


I've been believing in something so distant as if I was human  
And I've been denying this feeling of hopelessness  
In me, in me  
  
All the promises I made just to let you down  
You believed in me, but I'm broken  
I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
As much as I'd like the past not to exist it still does  
And as much as I'd like to fell like I belong here  
I'm just as scared as you  
  
I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
Run away, run away  
One day we won't feel this pain anymore  
Take it all the way  
Shadows of you  
'Cause they won't let me go  
  
So I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
Alone, and lost in paradise


Speak your mind  
Like I care  
I can see your lips moving  
I've just learned not to hear  
Don't waste your time  
  
It's never enough for you baby  
Don't want to play your game anymore  
No matter what you say  
I'm all out of love for you, baby  
And now that I've tried everything  
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone  
  
Take your time  
I'm not scared  
Make me everything you need me to be  
So the judgment seems fair  
Don't waste your time  
  
It's never enough for you baby  
Don't want to play your game anymore  
No matter what you say  
I'm all out of love for you, baby  
And now that I've tried everything  
I'll numb the pain till I am made to tear up my heart  
For the way that it feels  
I will still remember when you've long forgotten me  
  
It's never enough for you baby  
Don't want to play your game anymore  
No matter what you say  
I'm all out of love for you, baby  
And now that I've tried everything  
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone  
  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
It's never enough  
  
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone  
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone


Please, please forgive me,  
But I won't be home again.  
Maybe someday you'll have woke up,  
And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one:  
"Isn't something missing?"  
  
You won't cry for my absence, I know  
You forgot me long ago.  
Am I that unimportant?  
Am I so insignificant?  
Isn't something missing?  
Isn't someone missing me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Even though I'm the sacrifice,  
You won't try for me, not now.  
Though I'd die to know you love me,  
I'm all alone.  
Isn't someone missing me?  
  
Please, please forgive me,  
But I won't be home again.  
I know what you do to yourself,  
I breathe deep and cry out:  
"Isn't something missing?  
Isn't someone missing me?"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if I bleed, I'll bleed,  
Knowing you don't care.  
And if I sleep just to dream of you  
And wake without you there,  
Isn't something missing?  
Isn't something  
  
[Chorus]


I don't want to say goodbye  
I can see the fear inside your eyes  
It's so hard to walk away  
  
I know that this feels like the end  
Life never seems to let you win  
But I'll be back someday  
  
I'm already missing you  
But I'm not even gone  
In time we'll be together again  
And it won't be long  
  
Now everything goes up and down  
And the world keeps spinning round and round  
And still you're waiting there  
  
I'll try to make it another night  
And dream of you when I close my eyes  
Cause I'll be back someday  
  
I'm already missing you  
But I'm not even gone  
In time we'll be together again  
And it won't be long  
  
Just hold it in  
Don't let it go  
You'll always live  
Inside my soul


I will wander 'til the end of time, torn away from you  
  
I pull away to face the pain  
I close my eyes and drift away  
Over the fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Torn away from you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us from sorrow's hold  
Or from my hard heart  
  
I can't go on living this way  
And I can't go back the way I came  
Shamed of this fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Half a life without you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us, change, open your eyes to the light  
I denied it all so long, oh so long  
Say goodbye, goodbye  
  
My heart is broken  
Release me, I can't hold on  
Deliver us, my heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us, my heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us from sorrow's hold


Hold on to me love  
You know I can't stay long  
All I wanted to say was  
I love you and I'm not afraid  
Can you hear me?  
Can you feel me in your arms  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light,  
It ends here tonight.  
  
I'll miss the winter  
A world of fragile things  
Look for me in the white forest  
Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)  
I know you hear me,  
I can taste it in your tears.  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you  
Sweet raptured light,  
It ends here tonight.  
  
Closing your eyes to disappear  
You pray your dreams will leave you here,  
But still you wake and know the truth -  
No one's there.  
  
Say goodnight, don't be afraid  
Calling me, calling me, as you fade to black.  
  
(Say goodnight) Holding my last breath  
(Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself  
(Holding me) Are all my thoughts of you?  
Sweet raptured light,  
It ends here tonight.  
  
Holding my last breath  
Safe inside myself  
Are all my thoughts of you?  
Sweet raptured light,  
It ends here tonight.  
  
Holding my last breath


Save your twisted enemy  
So you might earn forgiveness  
You know you're whole world is waiting  
So why can't you speak?  
  
I feel it coming over me  
I'm still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything?  
Or just a new way to bleed?  
  
So go and tell all your friends  
That I'm a failure underneath  
If it makes you feel like a bigger man  
But it's my, my heart, my life  
That you're calling a lie  
I've played this game before  
And I can't take anymore  
  
I feel it coming over me  
I'm still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything?  
Or just a new way to bleed?  
  
I've drifted far beyond the end  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Can't you feel the ground caving in?  
Freedom!  
Give us a reason to believe again  
  
I feel it coming over me  
I'm still a slave to these dreams  
Is this the end of everything?  
Or just a new way to bleed?


Don't want to be the one to walk away  
But I can't bear the thought of one more day  
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost  
  
Can't find the road to lead us out of this  
A million miles from where we burned the bridge  
Can't keep pretending everything's going to be alright  
With the whole world falling down on me  
  
Cross the oceans in my mind  
Find the strength to say goodbye  
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands  
  
Fallen so far from where we were before  
You'll never find what you've been searching for  
Something to fill the void  
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you  
Like I could only dream to do  
  
Cross the oceans in my mind  
Find the strength to say goodbye  
Everything that we believed in was a lie  
  
Cross the oceans in your mind  
Find a way to blur the line  
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands  
  
Oh, we never learn  
So we fall down again  
Heaven, help me find a way to dream within this nightmare  
  
Cross the oceans in my mind  
Find the strength to say goodbye  
Everything that we believed in was a lie  
  
Cross the oceans in your mind  
Find a way to blur the line  
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands


I can't run anymore,  
I fall before you,  
Here I am,  
I have nothing left,  
Though I've tried to forget,  
You're all that I am,  
Take me home,  
I'm through fighting it,  
Broken,  
Lifeless,  
I give up,  
You're my only strength,  
Without you,  
I can't go on,  
Anymore,  
Ever again.  
  
My only hope,  
(All the times I've tried)  
My only peace,  
(To walk away from you)  
My only joy,  
My only strength,  
(I fall into your abounding grace)  
My only power,  
My only life,  
(And love is where I am)  
My only love.  
  
I can't run anymore,  
I give myself to you,  
I'm sorry,  
I'm sorry,  
In all my bitterness,  
I ignored,  
All that's real and true,  
All I need is you,  
When night falls on me,  
I'll not close my eyes,  
I'm too alive,  
And you're too strong,  
I can't lie anymore,  
I fall down before you,  
I'm sorry,  
I'm sorry.  
  
My only hope,  
(All the times I've tried)  
My only peace,  
(To walk away from you)  
My only joy,  
My only strength,  
(I fall into your abounding grace)  
My only power,  
My only life,  
(And love is where I am)  
My only love.  
  
Constantly ignoring,  
The pain consuming me,  
But this time it's cut too deep,  
I'll never stray again.  
  
My only hope,  
(All the times I've tried)  
My only peace,  
(To walk away from you)  
My only joy,  
My only strength,  
(I fall into your abounding grace)  
My only power,  
My only life,  
(And love is where I am)  
My only love,  
My only hope,  
(All the times I've tried)  
My only peace,  
(To walk away from you)  
My only joy,  
My only strength,  
(I fall into your abounding grace)  
My only power,  
My only life,  
(And love is where I am)  
My only love.

I'm only happy when it rains  
I'm only happy when it's complicated  
And though I know you can't appreciate it  
I'm only happy when it rains  
  
You know I love it when the news is bad  
And why it feels so good to feel so sad  
I'm only happy when it rains  
  
Pour your misery down, pour your misery down on me  
Pour your misery down, pour your misery down on me  
  
I'm only happy when it rains  
I feel good when things are going wrong  
I only listen to the sad, sad songs  
I'm only happy when it rains  
  
I only smile in the dark  
My only comfort is the night gone black  
I didn't accidentally tell you that  
I'm only happy when it rains  
  
You'll get the message by the time I'm through  
When I complain about me and you  
I'm only happy when it rains  
  
Pour your misery down (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down on me (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down on me (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down on me (Pour your misery down)  
Pour your misery down  
  
You can keep me company  
As long as you don't care  
  
I'm only happy when it rains  
You wanna hear about my new obsession?  
I'm riding high upon a deep depression  
I'm only happy when it rains (Pour some misery down on me)  
  
I'm only happy when it rains (Pour some misery down on me)  
I'm only happy when it rains (Pour some misery down on me)  
I'm only happy when it rains (Pour some misery down on me)  
I'm only happy when it rains (Pour some misery down on me)


Long lost words whisper slowly to me  
Still can't find what keeps me here  
And all this time I've been so hollow inside  
  
(And I know you're still there)  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I know I'll find you somehow  
  
Hunting you  
I can smell you  
alive  
Your heart pounding in my head  
  
Calling me  
Killing me  
I won't let you pull me down  
Saving me  
Raping me  
Watching me  
  
(Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you hold me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I won't let you hold me down)  
  
Watching me  
Wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you  
Loving you  
I won't let you hold me down


She embraced  
With a smile  
As she opened the door  
A cold wind blows  
It puts a chill  
Into my heart  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my love I gave to you  
  
(killer guitar riff)  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Lai lai lai la lai lai lai la lai lai lai lai lai la lai lai lai  
Lai lai lai la lai  
La la la lai  
La la la lai  
  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wander through  
All of my love I gave to you  
  
Lai la la  
Lai la la  
Lai lai lai  
  
Lai la la

I sense there's something in the wind  
That feels like tragedy's at hand  
And though I'd like to stand by him  
Can't shake this feeling that I have  
The worst is just around the bend  
  
And does he notice my feelings for him?  
And will he see how much he means to me?  
I think it's not to be  
  
What will become of my dear friend  
Where will his actions lead us then?  
Although I'd like to join the crowd  
In their enthusiastic cloud  
Try as I may, it doesn't last  
  
And will we ever end up together?  
Oh...  
  
And will we ever end up together?  
No, I think not, it's never to become  
For I am not the one


Embrace the silence  
'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
Taken all that you wanted  
Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
  
Hold on, little girl  
The end is soon to come  
  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes  
  
Oceans between us  
And there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
I can still taste the poison of every fall  
Every breath, our ways to heal  
  
Hold on, little girl  
The end is soon to come  
  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes  
  
Someday you'll know the peace  
Someday the light will break through  
And nothing you tell yourself  
Will save us from the truth  
  
Screamin' out  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes


Stop light, lock the door  
Don't look back  
Undress in the dark  
And hide from you, all of you  
  
You'll never know  
The way your words have haunted me  
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me  
You don't know me now or never  
  
You belong to me  
My snow white queen  
There's nowhere to run  
So let's just get it over  
  
Soon my love, you'll see  
You're just like me  
Don't scream anymore, my love  
'Cause all I want is you  
  
Wake up in a dream  
Frozen fear  
All your hands on me  
I can't scream, I can't scream  
  
I can't escape  
The twisted way you think of me  
I feel you in my dreams  
And I don't sleep, I don't sleep  
  
See you belong to me  
My snow white queen  
There's nowhere to run  
So let's just get it over  
  
Soon my love, you'll see  
You're just like me  
Don't scream anymore, my love  
'Cause all I want is you  
  
Can't save your life  
Though nothing I bleed for  
Is more tormenting  
  
I'm losing my mind  
And you just stand there  
And stare as my world divides  
  
You belong to me  
My snow white queen  
There's nowhere to run  
So let's just get it over  
  
Soon my love, you'll see  
You're just like me  
Don't scream anymore, my love  
'Cause all I want is you  
  
All I want is you  
All I want is you  
All I want is you


I've spent so much time  
Throwing rocks at your window  
That I never even knocked  
On your front door  
  
I walk by statues  
Never even made one chip away  
But if I could leave a mark  
On the monument of the heart  
I just might lay myself down  
For a little more than I had  
  
The last day  
The last day  
The last day  
  
Wait a time  
To spare these lies we tell ourselves  
These days have come and gone  
But this time is sweeter than honey


How many times have you told me you love her  
As many times as I wanted to tell you the truth  
How long have I stood here beside you  
I lived through you, you looked through me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Still with me is only you  
Ooh, Solitude  
I can't stay away from you  
  
How many times have I done this to myself  
How long will it take before I see  
When will this hole in my heart be mended  
Who now is left alone but me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Forever me and forever you  
Ooh, Solitude  
Only you, Only true  
  
Everyone leaves me stranded  
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind  
I can't stay here another night  
  
Your secret admirer, who could it be  
  
Can't you see all along it was me  
How can you be so blind as to see right through me  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Still with me as only you  
Ooh, Solitude  
I can't stay away from you  
  
Ooh, Solitude  
Forever me and forever you  
Ooh, Solitude  
Only you, only true


There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known.  
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done.  
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do.  
I wanna love somebody,  
Love somebody like you.  
  
An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays.  
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made.  
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do, mmm, mmm.  
I wanna love somebody,  
Love somebody like you.  
  
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,  
Shinin' down on me and you.  
When you put your arms around me,  
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do...  
  
I used to run in circles goin' no-where fast.  
I'd take one step forward and two steps back.  
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.  
I wanna love somebody,  
Love somebody like you.  
  
Whoa here we go now baby!  
  
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,  
Shinin' down on me and you.  
When you put your arms around me,  
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do.  
  
Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,  
But you're teachin' me to be a better man.  
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no.  
I wanna love somebody,  
Love somebody like you.  
  
I'm ready to love somebody,  
Love somebody like you. Oooh.  
  
An' I wanna love somebody,  
Love somebody like you, yeah.  
  
Oh yeah.  
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night,  
Shinin' like it's true.  
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you  
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way  
Wanna be a better man  
I see it in you yeah...


Is this real enough for you  
You were so confused  
Now that you've decided to stay  
We'll remain together  
You can't abandon me  
You belong to me  
  
Breathe in and take my life in you  
No longer myself, only you  
There's no escaping me my love  
Surrender  
  
Darling, there's no sense in running  
You know I will find you  
Everything is perfect now  
We can live forever  
You can't abandon me  
You belong to me  
  
Breathe in and take my life in you  
No longer myself, only you  
There's no escaping me my love  
Surrender  
  
Breathe in and take my life in you  
No longer myself only you  
There's no escaping me my love  
Surrender  
Surrender  
Surrender


Thought that I was strong  
I know the words I need to say  
Frozen in my place  
I let the moment slip away  
  
I've been screaming on the inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me, but it's not enough  
  
Never meant to lie  
But I'm not the girl you think you know  
The more that I am with you  
The more that I am all alone  
  
I've been screaming on the inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me, but it's not enough  
  
Not that I so different  
Not that I don't see  
The dying light of what we used to be  
But how could I forgive you?  
You've changed  
And I'm a liar by your side  
I'm about to lose my mind  
  
'Cause I've been screaming looking inside  
And I know you feel the pain  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
You've been dreaming  
If you're thinking  
That I still belong to you  
I've been dying,  
'Cause I'm lying to myself  
  
Say it's over  
Yes it's over  
But I need you anyway  
Say you love me but it's not enough


When they all come crashing down- midflight  
You know you're not the only one  
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life  
You know you're not the only one  
  
We're all grieving  
Lost and bleeding  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me  
  
So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized  
You know you're not the only one  
Never understood this life  
And you're right I don't deserve but you know I'm not the only one  
  
We're all grieving  
Lost and bleeding  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me  
  
Don't look down  
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you  
Don't look down, you'll fall down,  
You'll become their sacrifice  
Right or wrong  
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you  
If I can't feel, I'm not mine,  
I'm not real  
  
All our lives  
We've been waiting  
For someone to call our leader  
All your lies  
I'm not believing  
Heaven shine a light down on me


Never thought that I'd be leaving you today  
So alone and wondering why I feel this way  
So wide the world  
Can love remember how to get me home to you  
Someday  
  
We'll be together again  
All just a dream in the end  
We'll be together again  
  
So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind  
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find  
  
I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide  
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind  
  
We'll be together again  
All just a dream in the end


Do what you, what you want  
If you have a dream for better  
Do what you what you want  
Till you don't want it anymore (Remember who you really are)  
  
Do what you, what you want  
Your world's closing in on you now (It isn't over)  
Stand and face the unknown (Got to remember who you really are)  
Every heart in my hands like a pale reflection  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe we can break through  
  
Do what you, what you want  
You don't have to lay your life down (Is it over?)  
Do what you what you want  
Till you find what you're looking for (Got to remember who you really are)  
  
But every hour slipping by screams that I have failed you  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe  
  
There's still time, close your eyes  
Only love will guide you home  
Tear down the walls and free your soul  
Till we crash we're forever spiraling down, down, down, down  
  
Hello, hello, it's only me  
Infecting everything you love  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to learn forgiveness  
  
Hello, hello remember me?  
I'm everything you can't control  
Somewhere beyond the pain  
There must be a way to believe we can break through  
  
Remember who you really are  
Do what you want, you want


Catch me as I fall  
Say you're here and it's all over now  
Speaking to the atmosphere  
No one's here and I fall into myself  
  
This truth drives me  
Into madness  
I know I can stop the pain  
If I will it all away  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't turn away  
(Don't give in to the pain)  
Don't try to hide  
(Though they're screaming your name)  
Don't close your eyes  
(God knows what lies behind them)  
Don't turn out the light  
(Never sleep never die)  
  
I'm frightened by what I see  
But somehow I know  
That there's much more to come  
Immobilized by my fear  
  
And soon to be  
Blinded by tears  
I can stop the pain  
If I will it all away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fallen angels at my feet  
Whispered voices at my ear  
Death before my eyes  
Lying next to me I fear  
  
She beckons me  
Shall I give in  
Upon my end shall I begin  
Forsaking all I've fallen for  
I rise to meet my end  
  
[Chorus x3]


The words have been drained from this pencil  
Sweet words that I want to give you  
And I can't sleep  
I need to tell you  
Goodnight  
  
When we're together, I feel perfect  
When I'm pulled away from you, I fall apart  
All you say is sacred to me  
Your eyes are so blue  
I can't look away  
As we lay in the stillness  
You whisper to me  
  
Amy, marry me  
Promise you'll stay with me  
Oh you don't have to ask me  
You know you're all that I live for  
You know I'd die just to hold you  
Stay with you  
Somehow I'll show you  
That you are my night sky  
I've always been right behind you  
Now I'll always be right beside you  
  
So many nights I cried myself to sleep  
Now that you love me, I love myself  
I never thought I would say this  
I never thought there'd be  
You


I can't see your star, I can't see your star  
Though I patiently waited bedside for the death of today  
I can't see your star  
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away  
  
And I'm alone now  
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now  
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely  
Find your own way out  
  
I can't see your star, I can't see your star  
How can the darkness feel so wrong?  
  
And I'm alone now  
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now  
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely  
Find your own way out  
  
So far away  
It's growing colder without your love  
Why can't you feel me calling your name?  
Can't break the silence, it's breaking me  
  
All my fears turn to rage  
  
And I'm alone now  
Me and all I stood for, we're wandering now  
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely  
Find your own way out now  
  
Hey, and nothing worth fighting for  
We're wandering now  
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely  
Find your own way out


I'd give anything to give me to you  
Can you forget the world that you thought you knew?  
  
If you want me  
Come and find me (I'm here for you)  
Nothing's stopping you  
So please release me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll believe all your lies  
Just pretend you love me  
Make believe, close your eyes  
I'll be anything for you  
  
Nothing left to make me feel anymore  
There's only you and everyday I need more  
  
(If you want me) If you want me  
(Come and find me) Come and find me  
(Anything you want me to be) I'll do anything (anything) you say  
(For you) Just tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Anything for you  
  
I'll become your earth and sky  
Forever never die  
I'll be everything you need  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]


Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me  
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free  
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you  
And at sweet night, you are my own  
Take my hand  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name  
  
I have dreamt of a place for you and I  
No one knows who we are there  
All I want is to give my life only to you  
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore  
Let's run away, I'll take you there  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where no one needs a reason  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Don't look back you're safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No one's left to stop you  
  
Forget this life  
Come with me  
Don't look back you're safe now  
Unlock your heart  
Drop your guard  
No one's left to stop you now  
  
We're leaving here tonight  
There's no need to tell anyone  
They'd only hold us down  
So by the morning light  
We'll be half way to anywhere  
Where love is more than just your name


I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll  
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds  
But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to  
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved  
And I  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me  
  
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins  
I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed  
I can't go on like this  
I loathe all I've become  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me  
  
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more  
I have grown so weary of this lie I live  
  
I've woken now to find myself  
In the shadows of all I have created  
I'm longing to be lost in you  
(away from this place I have made)  
Won't you take me away from me


Seether:  
I wanted you to know that  
I love the way you laugh  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away...  
I keep your photograph and  
I know it serves me well  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away  
  
You've gone away, you don't feel me here, anymore  
  
Amy Lee:  
The worst is over now  
And we can breathe again  
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away  
There's so much left to learn  
And no one left to fight  
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm open  
And I don't feel like I am strong enough  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away  
  
Cause I'm broken when I'm open  
And I don't feel like I am strong enough  
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone away...  
  
Cause I'm Broken when I'm lonesome  
And I don't feel right when you're gone...  
You gone away, you don't feel me here anymore


Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Should I let you fall, lose it all  
So maybe you can remember yourself?  
Can't keep believing  
We're only deceiving ourselves  
And I'm sick of the lie  
And you're too late  
  
Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame  
Must be exhausting to lose your own game, selfishly hated  
No wonder you're jaded  
You can't play the victim this time  
And you're too late  
  
Don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
You want me, come find me  
Make up your mind  
  
You never call me when you're sober  
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over  
  
How could I have burned paradise?  
How could I?  
You were never mine!  
  
So don't cry to me, if you loved me  
You would be here with me  
Don't lie to me, just get your things  
I've made up your mind!


If you want to live, let live  
If you want to go, let go  
I'm not afraid to dream to sleep, sleep forever  
  
I don't need to touch the sky  
I just want to feel that high  
And you refuse to lift me  
  
Guess it wasn't real after all  
Guess it wasn't real all along  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
It's where I belong  
  
If you want to live, let live  
If you want to go, let go  
I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender  
  
Guess it wasn't real after all  
Guess it wasn't real all along  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
No light to lead the way  
Remember that all alone  
Is where I belong  
  
In a dream  
Will you give your love to me  
Beg my broken heart to beat  
Save my life, change my mind?  
  
If I fall and all is lost  
No light to lead the way  
Remember that all alone  
Is where I belong


Please don't ask me how  
I ended up at my wits end and breaking down  
Pages torn from books we never read  
Because we're plugged into this grid  
Don't pull this plug right now or then we'd really have to live  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
Your words won't save me now  
I'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow  
Get a grip on yourself is what they say  
Every hour every day  
Hands over my ears, I've been screaming all these years  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end that I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to
death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive  
  
We came in search of answers  
We left empty handed again  
Shots fired into the sky are now returning  
Where the fuck will you hide?  
  
Hiding from the laughter in the closet of our lives  
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light  
And now a hand's extending outward, quiet comfort they invite  
Do we dare take what they offer, do we step into the light?  
  
When I die will they remember not what I did but what I haven't done?  
It's not the end I fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death  
  
When we build these dreams on sand  
How they all slip through our hands  
This might be our only chance  
  
Let's take this one day at a time  
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine  
The time that we kill keeps us alive


It's too late to change your mind  
Even though this fragile world  
Is tearing apart at the seams  
We can't wash these sins away  
This sinking feeling everyday  
I'm waking up in someone else's life  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
'Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
Not gonna let this day go by  
I'm gonna save this wasted life  
And nothing can stand in my way  
Not enough to say goodbye  
Burn it til there's nothing left  
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
'Cause I cannot erase this lie  
  
The water's rising around us  
There is no other way down  
I only have myself to blame for it all  
  
Is it so hard for you?  
'Cause it's so hard for me  
To believe that what we dreamed  
Could ever come to life again  
If I could just erase my mind  
But I cannot erase this lie


Give me a reason to believe that you're gone  
I see your shadow so I know they're all wrong  
Moonlight on the soft brown earth  
It leads me to where you lay  
They took you away from me but now I'm taking you home  
  
[Chorus]  
I will stay forever here with you  
My love  
The softly spoken words you gave me  
Even in death our love goes on  
  
Some say I'm crazy for my love, oh my love  
But no bonds can hold me from your side, oh my love  
They don't know you can't leave me  
They don't hear you singing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I can't love you, anymore than I do


Perfect by nature  
Icons of self indulgence  
Just what we all need  
More lies about a world that  
  
Never was and never will be  
Have you no shame don't you see me  
You know you've got everybody fooled  
  
Look here she comes now  
Bow down and stare in wonder  
Oh how we love you  
No flaws when you're pretending  
But now I know she  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you've got everybody fooled  
  
Without the mask where will you hide  
Can't find yourself lost in your lie  
  
I know the truth now  
I know who you are  
And I don't love you anymore  
  
Never was and never will be  
You don't know how you've betrayed me  
And somehow you have everybody fooled  
  
It never was and never will be  
You're not real and you can't save me  
Somehow now you're everybody's fool


Fall Into You  
David Hodges feat. Amy Lee  
  
Seems so far  
That I have gone down this road  
Only to find that it ends  
But lookin' back  
There is one thing that I know  
I can't make it all alone again  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
But all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
So lead me  
Guide me  
Hold me  
Hide me in love  
With all that you are  
And all that you do  
  
Hear me  
Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh God  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall Into you  
  
Just catch me as I fall  
But all this time  
I have felt so alone  
Losing myself in my despair  
With loving arms  
You were waiting for me to let go  
With every step  
You were there  
  
'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own  
When all I need is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh my child  
How I have longed  
For you to come home  
To where you belong  
All of your life  
If you could just see  
All of my joy  
When you are here with me (X2)  
  
Hear me Take me  
Mold me  
Break me, oh god  
Just fill all of me  
As I fall into you


I still remember the world  
From the eyes of a child  
Slowly those feelings  
Were clouded by what I know now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
An uneven trade for the real world  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all  
  
I still remember the sun  
Always warm on my back  
Somehow it seems colder now  
  
Where has my heart gone  
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger  
I want to go back to  
Believing in everything


Why do you cry for me?  
Why do you fake that you don't see me?  
When you change everybody's path  
But you know that...  
One day you are going to see me with different eyes  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
If I die, the love that I feel for you will ressucitateme from  
The gray of the evil and dark  
And the sun will shine for me again, yeah  
The love is indestructible against the evil  
I dream that I have you with me  
So tell me why do you cry for me?  
Come with me, you won't regret it  
  
Chorus:  
  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the death  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
(Repeat chorus 2x)


I wanted you to be with me  
For so long I don't even know by now  
But now that I've given up on you  
Defiantly you see me  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you  
  
There's something very wrong about this  
I think you knew all along somehow  
You'll only take me to change my mind  
Lonely, broken, and defeated  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
(I see through you)  
Now that I know the way you play  
I don't want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you  
  
So far away I see the truth  
I see through you  
(I see through you)  
Now that I know the way you play  
I don't want to  
  
Walking away I see the pain  
You put me through  
(I see through you)  
Lost in your game to change the same  
Forever gone, forever you


I've been watching you from a distance  
That distance sees through your disguise  
All I want from you is your hurting  
I want to heal you  
I want to save you from the dark  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Why should I care if they hurt you  
Somehow it matters more to me  
Than if I were hurting myself  
Save you (save you)  
I'll save you  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
I'll have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Give unto me your troubles  
I'll endure your suffering  
Place onto me your burden  
I'll drink your deadly poison  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness  
Give unto me all that frightens you  
I'll have your nightmares for you  
If you sleep soundly  
  
Fear not the flame of my love's candle  
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness


Now I will tell you what I've done for you  
Fifty thousand tears I've cried  
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you  
And you still won't hear me  
  
(I'm going under)  
  
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself  
Maybe I'll wake up for once  
Not tormented daily defeated by you  
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom  
I'm dying again  
  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm going under  
  
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies  
So I don't know what's real and what's not  
Always confusing the thoughts in my head  
So I can't trust myself anymore  
I'm dying again  
  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm  
  
So go on and scream  
Scream at me I'm so far away  
I won't be broken again  
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under  
  
I'm dying again  
I'm going under, (going under)  
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)  
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)  
I've got to break through, I'm going under  
Going under  
I'm going under


Under your spell again  
I can't say no to you  
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand  
I can't say no to you  
  
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly  
Now I can't let go of this dream  
I can't breathe but I feel  
  
Good enough  
I feel good enough for you  
  
Drink up sweet decadence  
I can't say no to you  
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind  
I can't say no to you  
  
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely  
Now I can't let go of this dream  
Can't believe that I feel  
  
Good enough  
I feel good enough  
It's been such a long time coming  
But I feel good  
  
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall  
Pour real life down on me  
'Cause I can't hold on to anything  
  
This good enough  
Am I good enough  
For you to love me too?  
  
So take care what you ask of me  
'Cause I can't say no


Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit.  
There isn't any other stair quite like it.  
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top.  
So this is the stair where I always stop.  
  
Halfway up the stairs isn't up and isn't down.  
It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town.  
And all sorts of funny thoughts run round my head.  
It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead.  
  
Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit.  
There isn't any other stair quite like it.  
I'm not at the bottom, I'm not at the top.  
So this is the stair where I always stop.


Long lost words whisper slowly to me  
Still can't find what keeps me here  
When all this time I've been so hollow inside  
I know you're still there  
  
Watching me wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you loving you  
I won't let you pull me down  
  
Hunting you I can smell you - alive  
Your heart pounding in my head  
  
Watching me wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Saving me raping me  
Watching me  
  
Watching me, wanting me  
I can feel you pull me down  
Fearing you, loving you  
I won't let you pull me down


Way down  
I've been way down  
Underneath this skin  
Waiting to hear my name again  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
If I hear them calling  
And nothing can hold me  
  
Way down (Do you really want me?)  
All the way down (Do you really want me?)  
I will hear your voice (Do you really want me?)  
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me)  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling  
  
I was looking to the sky  
When I knew I'd be swimming home  
And I cannot betray my kind  
They are here, it's my time  
  
I'm sorry  
Nothing can hold me (Do you really want me?)  
I adore you still  
But I hear them calling, (calling)  
And nothing can hold me


You don't remember me, but I remember you  
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you  
But who can decide what they dream?  
And dream I do  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
Have you forgotten all I know  
And all we had?  
You saw me mourning my love for you  
And touched my hand  
I knew you loved me then  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I look in the mirror and see your face  
If I look deep enough  
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
You're taking over me


Nobody on the road  
Nobody on the beach  
I feel it in the air  
The summer's out of reach  
Empty lake, empty streets  
The sun goes down alone  
I'm drivin' by your house  
Though I know you're not at home  
  
But I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I never will forget those nights  
I wonder if it was a dream  
Remember how you made me crazy?  
Remember how I made you scream  
Now I don't understand what happened to our love  
But babe, I'm gonna get you back  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
Out on the road today, I saw a black flag sticker on a Cadillac  
A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You cannever look back."  
I thought I knew what love was  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever  
I should just let them go but  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun  
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone


Make me whole again, open your eyes  
Taunted by the shadows of your lie  
Cold and far away like you're not even mine  
Undo everything and take me higher  
Never believing what they say 'cause I'm  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I'm not giving in, I want you back  
Holding together by the shards of our past  
Stole my heart away, I can't let you go  
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below  
Over and over in my mind  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
I am so lost without my place inside your heart  
I won't survive I need to know you hear me  
Awaken and release my love  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home  
  
Counting the days to meet you on the other side  
I will always be waiting  
Until the day that I see you on the other side  
Come and take me home


Its just the way it is  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
No body can change  
  
You come around, every day  
Trying to get in my way  
I want you go get away  
Its just not the same old game  
Its not just the same old thing  
The same old relationship  
That had the same old thing  
  
  
Its just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
Its been years, it's been hours  
Many days I can't seem to remember  
I thought this was forever  
But it just can't be,  
The only things that don't last forever  
Are just you and me.  
  
It's just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
  
  
Guess it wasn't forever  
It's just the way it is  
The way it is,  
Way it is,  
Way it is.


All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumping through the pages of my fantasies  
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  
I'll see you try to take a swing at me  
Come on, gonna put on the ground, ground, ground  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies  
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown  
I'll kill and rape you the way you raped me  
And I'll pull the trigger  
And you're down, down, down  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny? what the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying while you're bloody down in front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
All my friends are gone,  
They died  
They all screamed, and cried  
I'm gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
Gonna take you down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down and  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Down  
  
All of my hate cannot be bound  
I will no be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
Now you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming


I tried to kill the pain  
But only brought more  
(So much more)  
I lay dying  
And I'm pouring, crimson regret, and betrayal  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
Do you remember me?  
Lost for so long  
Will you be on the other side?  
Will you forget me?  
  
I'm dying  
Praying  
Bleeding  
Screaming  
  
Am I too lost to be saved?  
Am I too lost?  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
(Return to me salvation)  
(I want to die!)  
  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
My God! My tourniquet  
Return to me salvation  
  
My wounds cry for the grave  
My soul cries, for deliverance  
Will I be denied?  
Christ! Tourniquet! My suicide


"You hold the answer deep within your own mind  
Consciously, you've forgotten it  
That's the way the human mind works  
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful  
For us to entertain, we reject it  
We erase it from our memory  
But the imprint is always there"  
  
(Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't cry it all away)  
  
The pain that grips you  
The fear that binds you  
Releases life in me  
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes  
To blind them from the truth that finds a way from who we are  
  
Please don't be afraid  
When the darkness fades away  
The dawn will break the silence screaming in our hearts  
My love for you still grows  
This I do for you  
Before I try to fight the truth my final time  
  
"We're supposed to try and be real  
And I feel alone, and we're not together  
And that is real"  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Lying beside you  
Listening to you breathe  
The life that flows inside of you  
Burns inside of me  
Hold and speak to me  
Of love without a sound  
Tell me you will live through this  
And I will die for you  
Cast me not away  
Say you'll be with me  
For I know I cannot bear it all alone  
  
"You're not alone, honey  
Never, never"  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
It just won't fade away  
  
Can't wash it all away  
Can't wish it all away  
Can't cry it all away  
Can't scratch it all away  
  
Can't fight it all away  
Can't hope it all away  
Can't scream it all away  
Oh, it all away  
Oh, it all away  
  
"But the imprint is always there  
Nothing is ever really forgotten"  
  
"God, please, don't hate me  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
Because I'll die if you do  
  
Because I'll die if you do"


Feels like the weight of the world  
Like God in heaven gave me a turn  
Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you  
Still in the dark, can you fix me?  
  
Free fall, free fall, all through life  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be  
She's nothing to me  
  
Feels like the weight of the world  
Like all my screaming has gone unheard  
And oh, I know you don't believe in me  
Safe in the dark, how can you see?  
  
Free fall, free fall, all through life  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I was  
  
If you love me then let go of me  
I won't be held down by who I used to be


You're too important for anyone  
There's something wrong with everything you see  
But I, I know who you really are  
You're the one who cries when you're alone  
  
[Chorus]  
But where will you go  
With no one left to save you from yourself  
You can't escape  
You can't escape  
  
You think that I can't see right through your eyes  
Scared to death to face reality  
No one seems to hear your hidden cries  
You're left to face yourself alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I realize you're afraid  
But you can't abandon everyone  
You can't escape  
You don't want to escape  
  
I'm so sick of speaking words that no one understands  
Is it clear enough that you can't live your whole life all alone  
I can hear you in a whisper  
But you can't even hear me screaming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I realize you're afraid  
But you can't reject the whole world  
You can't escape  
You won't escape  
You can't escape  
You don't want to escape
